<p>So I think I&rsquo;m coming up on a year of blogging.  I don&rsquo;t actually know which was the day that I started blogging daily. I can see one that I posted on <a href="http://linklens.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/moving-beyond-toy-problems.html">June 20th 2016</a>.  At the beginning I was posting in different locations each day.  But here&rsquo;s another on <a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2016/06/21/agile-approach-to-login-signup-problems/">June 21st 2016</a> so although I did blog on <a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2016/05/17/collaborating-in-software-teams/">May 17th 2016</a> I didn&rsquo;t get into the daily rhythm until later in June.  I&rsquo;d almost convinced myself that I started in late May so that I could be wrapping up now, but my obsessive nature means I will probably force myself to go all the way to June 20th.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting thing to do for a year, but I think a change will also be welcome.  While I&rsquo;ve demonstrated that I can blog daily and there&rsquo;s been some value for me in organising my thoughts, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gained much of a following or inspired many people.  Part of the idea of blogging is to get all my ideas about the future of AgileVentures out of my head and accessible to others.  I&rsquo;ve been aided by tireless review from Federico and I think there&rsquo;s definitely some extent to which my blogging has distributed my ideas amongst the AgileVentures members, but at the same time my blogs are largely unpolished streams of consciousness and I&rsquo;ve been more focused on cranking them out than I have on making them intelligible.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s also an extent to which the frenetic activity on my part drowns out other voices in the community.  We&rsquo;d probably be in a much stronger state as a community if we had four or five different people each blogging weekly.  I sense that my voice is too strong.  I suspect that my too loud voice and my blogging about &ldquo;Legacy Code&rdquo; affected my co-founder&rsquo;s decision to step back from the community.   I&rsquo;m going to carry on to June 20th but I&rsquo;m now itching to replace my daily blog with a daily focus on the AgileVentures website.  My latest hypothesis is that if I spent as much time on the tone of voice and content in the AV site as I did on my blogs we might be a bit further along to achieving financial stability.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see.  Right now I feel pretty low about the many areas that need fixing up to make the AV site and its value propositions comprehensible to the new members coming in from the MOOC, our Google Adwords grant and my appearances on Ruby Rogues.  I feel pretty down about the MOOC as well, where I would like to have upgraded to Rails 5 and have lots more improved content.  Juggling everything I&rsquo;m just about managing to hold those two properties down to have basic consistency.  I feel a bit better about the NHS HLP wiki project, and of course we&rsquo;re at that point that I have to focus on paid projects.  Yesterday I had a good, albeit cut off, chat with a person based in Myanmar about a non-profit project that might have some funding, and today is the deadline for a local non-profit project bid.  </p>

<p>The funny thing here is the ongoing decision making about putting in bids - too high and you don&rsquo;t get anything, too low and you&rsquo;re on a deathmarch trying to deliver the goods.  I start to see the attraction of the salaried 9-5 where someone tells you what to do and you get paid a consistent amount.  Still, salaried jobs come and go as well.  At least I get to spend more time with my kids working on all this from home.   Time for a break for a week - I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;ve got a design sprint planned for the week of June 12th.  I&rsquo;m hoping we can all get on the same page regarding the AgileVentures experience.  What seems strange to me is that we can get 40 or so Premium members, but we seem to have plateaued.  We&rsquo;re only growing very slowly, getting a few upgrades here and there.  We&rsquo;re doing a lot of marketing activity but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be translating in converting members to Premium.  Hopefully the design sprint might help us get to the bottom of that conundrum.  I&rsquo;m not sure what the year of blogging achieved - time to try out some alternatives &hellip;</p>
