        <h5 class='date'>10 May 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="anxiety" src="/images/anxiety.jpg" /></p>

<p>Recently I feel like I&rsquo;m playing a game of anxiety managment.  This morning I slept through my alarm and failed to get up for my morning run.  Skipping it, I got on with the rest of the morning routine.  I&rsquo;ve realised I can listen to a technical blog on x2 while preparing the Japanese Kanji character tests for my kids during breakfast.  Maybe the multi-tasking is making me anxious? :-) To be honest I think the anxiety comes from worrying about having enough money to feed my kids and delivering successfully on the NHS project, as well as feeling that I&rsquo;m not making the right choices about how to sustain the AgileVentures charity effectively.  I&rsquo;m trying to listen to all these podcasts to keep up with the changing tech landscape, connect with others on twitter and put interesting content into the AV slack.  My anxiety was not decreased by ending up reviewing Slack and email before this morning&rsquo;s blog - curses &hellip; :-)</p>

<p>Last night I was trying to practice the guitar (outside a local church hall where my kids were doing activities), but couldn&rsquo;t focus.  I calmed myself by spending thirty minutes creating private premium chat rooms for AV Premium members.  Over the last 9 months I&rsquo;ve been giving AV Premium members individual support in direct messages and it&rsquo;s not feeling so scalable.  AV Mentor Craig and I had been chatting about this in #mentor-notifications; and agreed that by having a dedicated private Premium support channel for each Premium member it would mean that there&rsquo;s a place that mentors can join me in giving individual support.  Also it&rsquo;s somewhere that mentors can see the history of support that the individual member is getting via Slack. </p>

<p>Craig had already joined me in one new Premium mob member&rsquo;s private channel where we&rsquo;re both able to give him support, and maybe a coherent setup here will allow me to step back a little and focus on increasing the number of Premiums and bringing in more contracts for AV.  So anyhow, while my guitar lay idle I created another handful of private Premium rooms and told the mentors about the backgrounds of the different Premium members hoping to get individual mentors interested in making connections with individual Premium members via these private channels.  I hooked up a few - members seem pleased to see the channels.  I think it&rsquo;s a good way to go - I&rsquo;ll keep adding handfuls of these private channels and then once they&rsquo;re all set up I can hopefully take passes on giving support and gradually get more and more mentors involved &hellip;</p>

<p>That out of the way, I was paying down more anxiety by getting on with preparation for another MOOC launch.  I do now have the start date corresponding to the training course and got live the first phase of the TAs helping with the MOOC.  I also went ahead and added as MOOC staff members all those who&rsquo;d shared their email addresses to join the pivotal tracker.  I&rsquo;d held off on this before as it gives them power to edit the course.  Usually we just give them beta-access so they can see the content a week early, but they get blocked because they can&rsquo;t see anything until the course actually goes live.  There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a workaround for this, so I went for distributing control.</p>

<p>Some NHS project anxiety was paid down yesterday when we ran a successful training event in Marylebone for a wider group of HLP staff members who seemed to enjoy using the wiki.  We got another set of valuable insights into the sticking points of the software, but then there&rsquo;s the quandry of what changes to make to make the system easier to use.  We&rsquo;ve gone with allowing anyone to make accounts, which meant that the set up before users could edit was much simpler in this second training session.  Here are the issues we encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Help Page currently goes to the general mediawiki site - should make it local</li>
<li>If the visual editor fails then when creating a page we don&rsquo;t see the moderation popup</li>
<li>Create page actions defaults to text editor which can be confusing</li>
<li>Visual editor pop up (that allows switching) doesn&rsquo;t have a dismiss &lsquo;X&rsquo;</li>
<li>Everyone would like the ability to upload pdfs, ppts, excel, word docs etc.</li>
<li>Image upload hidden behind insert -&gt; media - then upload tab</li>
<li>Start editing for VE appears too often (maybe when attempting to edit subsections)</li>
</ul>

<p>We had 5 HLP staff from the Prevention and Mental Health teams attend this training session; and they were enthusiastic about editing and experimenting with the wiki.  So much so that we focused the session on the basic editing, and didn&rsquo;t go quite so deep into the moderation section.  The new change manager is also adding lots of extra content and I&rsquo;m helping him with that, as well as how to get all the images out of the exising PDF.  What&rsquo;s making me anxious about the hard launch on Friday is getting enough content in there.  Other things on my radar and causing my heart to race include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensuring the banner is dynamic</li>
<li>practising a restore from backup</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to be digitizing everything I&rsquo;ve learned from the ongoing NHS design sprint and working with all the different stakeholders to get their materials into the system, but I have to put that to one side in order to get the two above items done.  I&rsquo;ve got three more stakeholder meetings (usability testings) over the next two days which play merry havoc with my ability to make progress on technical issues due to intermittent connectivity as I commute around on trains.  Well I have some time this morning.  Time to get it done &hellip; and lots of deep breathing to manage the anxiety :-)</p>
