<p>I&rsquo;ve been daily blogging for a year now.  Working day blogs that is.  I haven&rsquo;t been blogging on weekends, or national holidays, or during my vacations.  I&rsquo;ve been pretty consistent.  I think there&rsquo;s been a couple of days where work was super busy due to the tail end of a design sprint or something, but I&rsquo;ve managed to retro-actively blog and keep it one per work day.  I started blogging in June last year doing a blog on a different platform each day of the week, but fairly soon I fell into a pattern of blogging to our AgileVentures middleman site, and then re-releasing to Medium after I&rsquo;d got a little distance from the blog itself.</p>

<p>What was the purpose of this blog frenzy?  My memory is that it was about trying to communicate more effectively.  I often end up assuming that people understand my thoughts and intentions and it turns out that actually they don&rsquo;t.  Of course why would they?  There are few telepaths around.  I&rsquo;m also a bit of a gabbler and my sense is that it&rsquo;s not super easy to understand what I&rsquo;m trying to communicate.  So blogging, get all the thoughts down in text, provide them in an accessible form for everyone to read, and maybe reduce my need to gabble on and on about things.  Win win, no?  There&rsquo;s also the motivation that blogging at the start of each day is a kind of &ldquo;morning pages&rdquo; activity such as writers use to start off their days and clear their heads.  I don&rsquo;t think writers usually publish their morning brain dump, but I have certainly found the process of starting each day with writing out my thoughts to be reassuring and relaxing.  </p>

<p>Earlier in the year when I was doing a lot more coding, the blogs tended to be all about the previous day&rsquo;s coding.  As AgileVentures became an official charity and my admin load increased, they have tended to be about prioritization.  Starting the day with a blog is certainly less stressful than starting the day with a review of email and Slack conversations, which will generally lead to many adds to my ever-increasing todo list.  Has the time been well spent?  I&rsquo;m not sure.  I&rsquo;ve had positive reactions to some blogs, but my sense is that the blogs are too long, too stream-of-consciousness, too un-focused to gain much traction.  I think I may have even alienated some with my uncensored and unedited thought processes.</p>

<p>Ever since I was 17 I&rsquo;ve never really had trouble just generating text, and from even earlier I was always a talker.  It&rsquo;s like my internal thought wheel is hooked up directly to my mouth, and at will I can hook it up to a pen or a keyboard and just dump my thoughts straight out, for better or for worse.  So I rarely have writer&rsquo;s block, but it leaves me with a different problem.  How to edit the thicket of thoughts and ideas, so as to more effectively communicate them?</p>

<p>Getting to the end of a year of blogging prompts thoughts of changing things going forward.  There&rsquo;ve been times in the past when rising early I&rsquo;ve done 3 hours of programming before breakfast.  After recent design sprints I think about doing coding sprints, or other activities that fill the week in different ways.  Should it be one blog a week with the blog being edited and revised each day, so that a single polished blog can be released on Friday?  I guess it all depends on what one wants to achieve, and hasn&rsquo;t the Buddhist in me been trying to follow a path of consecrated action, where one is totally unattached to the outcomes of activities?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have loved my blogs to have provoked more positive responses of &ldquo;yes, let&rsquo;s build a solution to that together &hellip;&rdquo;, although there has been some of that.  What I really would like is for AgileVentures to be a healthy thriving community providing great learning experiences for many, while also helping charitable causes around the world.  The process of reflection over the last year does make me think that we&rsquo;re far too text heavy in many, many parts of our interface with the world.  One of the most attractive ideas for me going forward is that I&rsquo;d spend my blogging time each day focused on a part of the main AgileVentures site, converting it from text heavy to text light and adding images.  I have a hunch that, by doing this in strategic places throughout the site, we could improve the sign up rates, the number of members joining projects and the numbers signing up for Premium subscriptions, the source of our financial sustainability.</p>

<p>That said, I have a feeling I won&rsquo;t be able to shake the blogging habit.  The process has become too solidly part of my daily routine.  The thing that actually gets me started and ready to work in the mornings.  So, anyhow, starting tomorrow, blogs that focus on parts of the main AgileVentures site.  I&rsquo;m going to work through it one day at a time.</p>

<p>p.s. this blog released early for inclusion in our July newsletter, earlier blogs are all in draft form in GitHub and will be on this site soon</p>
