        <h5 class='date'>31 Jan 2017</h5>

<p>It was a busy Monday with us recording the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/agileventures/agile-book-club-podcast-episode-1-fifty-quick-ideas-to-improve-your-user-stories-by-adzic-evans/download.mp3">first of our &ldquo;Agile Book Club&rdquo; podcasts</a>, and other back to back meetings.  There&rsquo;s lots to discuss and plan on the marketing front, now that the Google AdWords grant is driving five times the usual traffic to our site.  However the biggest news of the day was a proposed paid project from our sponsor, drie.  drie wants to move fast to get their products onto the AWS Marketplace and they need a dashboard to go with their GitHub integration to allow users to manage their deployments to the drie cloud.</p>

<p>Paid projects have been a core concept of the AgileVentures Premium plans strategy since their inception. The idea is that signing up for a Premium plan subscription makes a member eligible for consideration for a paid project.  It&rsquo;s intended as an incentive to sign up for Premium plans, and also a demonstration of commitment on the part of the member.  We&rsquo;ve had a couple of small paid projects in the past, and including eligibility for those projects as part of the Premium package is motivated by the experience on some of those earlier projects.</p>

<p>In an unpaid project it&rsquo;s easy for the learning experience of the participants to be first and foremost.  They are after all putting in their time voluntarily.  In a paid project the situation changes; additional funds are being contributed by the client to ensure that some functionality is available in a particular timeframe.  There&rsquo;s clearly little motivation for a client to contribute those funds if the sole objective is the learning experience for the developers.  There&rsquo;s a tension here.  If the objective was simply learning and not on the product being generated, then perhaps those funds might be better contributed to a university or other institution which has learning as the sole objective?  Perhaps, but what about when the objective on the part of the learners is to become proficient at delivering products in the real world?</p>

<p>Unpaid projects in AgileVentures still have real clients and real requirements to simulate a real paid project, but with much less pressure.  In a paid project that pressure is there.  It&rsquo;s a fantastic learning opportunity and an important resume addition; that you are a developer who has been paid to produce some code.  Maybe that shouldn&rsquo;t make much difference, but it seems to be important to many employers and recruiters.</p>

<p>drie have generated a backlog of stories for us, of which six have been given top priority:</p>
<pre class="highlight gherkin"><code><span class="err">As</span> <span class="err">as</span> <span class="err">user</span> 
<span class="nf">I</span> want to see which of my repos drie would build and tell drie which it should build. 
<span class="err">So</span> <span class="err">that,</span> <span class="err">drie</span> <span class="err">builds</span> <span class="err">the</span> <span class="err">repos</span> <span class="nf">I</span> want built and not the ones I dont want built

<span class="err">As</span> <span class="err">someone</span> <span class="err">who</span> <span class="err">pushed</span> <span class="nf">a</span> change
<span class="nf">I</span> want to see if it built successfully and if there are changes that failed.

<span class="err">As</span> <span class="err">someone</span> <span class="err">who</span> <span class="err">built</span> <span class="nf">a</span> branch 
<span class="nf">I</span> want to see the build logs 
<span class="err">so</span> <span class="err">that</span> <span class="nf">I</span> can debug why the build failed

<span class="err">As</span> <span class="nf">a</span> user
<span class="nf">I</span> want to be able to access the URL to my running app

<span class="err">As</span> <span class="err">someone</span> <span class="err">running</span> <span class="nf">an</span> app, 
<span class="nf">I</span> want to see the applications logs 
<span class="err">so</span> <span class="err">that</span> <span class="nf">I</span> can debug why its not working

<span class="err">As</span> <span class="nf">a</span> user 
<span class="nf">I</span> want to log into my dashboard using github
</code></pre>
<p>In our meeting yesterday we talked through these top six stories and I made additional notes in the Trello cards to do my best to capture the nuances of what the client wanted.  I also pulled in screenshots from other existing systems that have parallel with the kinds of things they want.  drie has committed to making the whole project open source, which ticks important boxes for us at AgileVentures, where one of our twin goals is learning.  We avoid working on closed-source projects because of the difficulty this presents in terms of sharing the learning experience with the rest of the community.</p>

<p>Now we need to come up with a budget for getting this done, and getting it done within a 2 to 3 week timeframe.  We have a pool of 30 premium members who are eligible to be involved with the project.  I&rsquo;ve got to perform a complex series of calculations to ensure that drie gets value for money, that we have the right number of sufficiently experienced folks on the team, and that I get compensated for my own time while simultaneously not driving myself into the ground AND keeping all the other different parts of AgileVentures ticking along.  No pressure then :-)</p>
