        <h5 class='date'>31 Mar 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="design sprint" src="/images/design_sprint.png" /></p>

<p>Yesterday I worked from my home office and had a phone call with a CCG commissioner.  We tried Skype, but it seemed like the NHS firewall was blocking us again. We switched to iPhone FaceTime and we were able to speak eye to eye and I was able to show a few of our sketches, but it was basically just the phone.  I&rsquo;m starting to get the impression that NHS work seems to involve a lot of phone calls.  I was speaking to a CCG Commissioner working in Hackney where they are running a social-prescribing service.  I talked them through the long term goals from our Design Sprint which they concurred with and added a note that patient activation is also a key challenge. I take this to mean getting patients to take the initiative for self-care and asking for social-prescribing (or taking up the suggestions of a social prescription provider).  The commissioner also mentioned that it can be difficult to evidence outcomes, e.g. reduction of demand on G.P.s or changes in levels of anxiety and depression for patients, partly because it&rsquo;s difficult to measure, but also because these schemes take time to have an impact.  Apparently a <a href="http://www.health.org.uk/programmes/shine-2014/projects/social-prescribing-integrating-gp-and-community-health-assets">recent independent evaluation</a> has not shown significant changes in health outcomes, although qualitative interviews indicated a very positive participant experience.  The report includes some interview recordings which you can see here:</p>

<p align='center'><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCxRLAM7wBQ"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/PCxRLAM7wBQ/0.jpg" alt="Hackney Social Prescribing Interviews" /></a></p>

<p>The commissioner and I reviewed our team&rsquo;s &ldquo;How Might We Fail&rdquo; notes together, and they concurred and added another problem that we might be competing with existing systems, such as directories of services already created by local authorities.</p>

<p>I asked how Hackney came to have a Social Prescribing (SP) model and was told that there was a vibrant voluntary sector in Hackney and lots of very proactive G.P.s. Apparently CCGs tend to follow the clinicians lead, and so initiatives from doctors make all the difference.  Hackney CCG did a tender for setting up social prescribing and got a service provider to implement it for them.  I asked for more detail on where the original initiative came from, but since the commissioner had started after the program began we couldn&rsquo;t be sure of the original source of the program.</p>

<p>The commissioner also mentioned that SP has quite a high profile nationally - that it&rsquo;s in all the NHS STPs (Sustainability and Transformation Plans) and in all the five year forward views.  I showed our implementation maps (over iPhone FaceTime) and the comissioner concurred with our diagrams; I mentioned Steve&rsquo;s Capable Communities initiative in Harrow which got funding for SP by pulling down money from central government via the local authority and the commissioner indicated that sometimes local authority funding might actually be a better fit for SP.  Another possibility mentioned was social impact bonds, and the concern that some commissioners might have that maybe SP shouldn&rsquo;t be a core concern for a health care coordinator.</p>

<p>The commissioner indicated that the key is the community sector and that there was still debate at a national level about whether SP should be gate kept by GPs or would it work better with a model of self-referral.  Apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dixon_(doctor)">Michael Dixon</a> is the clinical lead for SP at the national level and he is very aligned with the GP model.</p>

<p>I asked the commissioner how they gathered and received information to inform the decision making processes.  The commissioner indicated it was very helpful to reach out to service providers and service users and to speak to individuals.  Asking public health individuals to go and gather evidence was helpful and that they spent time reading and researching with access to academic papers (e.g. via &ldquo;openathens&rdquo; which all NHS staff can access), googling things, looking up evidence based research, attending events and conferences.  I asked if they used any digital support such as writing up notes on what they&rsquo;d read in Word, and was told that it was more of just saving relevant files and keeping a folder of research papers on particular subjects so that a good context would be in mind to inform decision making.</p>

<p>The comissioner also mentioned that neighbouring CCGs would call to ask about how to implement SP, indicating that peer sharing was an important mechanism.  Neighbouring CCGs would often have quite specific questions, and that the comissioner might send them outcome summaries or service specifications for their own SP implementation to give them help in understanding what to do.  Apparently these are not public documents per se, and might have commercially sensitive information that SP service providers would not want shared, since they might be competing for other CCG tenders.</p>

<p>I asked the commissioner if they would be interested in using the proposed wiki solution, which they would, although they didn&rsquo;t usually contribute to online resources like wikipedia.  The commissioners usual tools are apparently Word, Excel and email and of course lots of face to face communication and phone.  The commissioner indicated that, if they were to be using such an online wiki, that they&rsquo;d probably need prompting (the commissioner gave an example of some other system where they got an email once every six months), and that, based on what other CCGs asked, that something like a FAQ or top-tips would be appreciated, e.g. the five key things you have to have in place to set up SP in your area, etc.</p>

<p>The commissioner indicated that they would be willing to try out some demo versions of our system in the next few weeks, and I had a lot to think about.  This process of phone calls without access to Skype or Hangouts was going to mean that we couldn&rsquo;t do any usability testing with the majority of the people that the HLP change manager was reaching out to.  It was already Thursday and at least half the people booked for Friday were going to be contacting us by phone.   Thursday is supposed to be the day of the design Sprint where we generate a prototype for testing on Friday, but we were still completing expert interviews that are supposed to be completed on day one.  It was clear to me that Friday was going to just be more expert interviews and the design sprint was going to have to be split over two weeks, if not more &hellip;</p>
