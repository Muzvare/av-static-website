        <h5 class='date'>14 Mar 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="sprinting" src="/images/full.jpg" /></p>

<p>Monday saw full hangouts for the &ldquo;Martin Fowler&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kent Beck&rdquo; scrums.  It was at least partly because SUNY Binghamton students were coming in to vote as part of their class assignment, but also the return of previous regulars such as Tong Wei and Raphael.  Also contributing was the running of the LocalSupport kick off in the latter scrum, which brought in three Kenyan developers.  Great to be having busy hangouts - allowing lots of new folks to see aspects of the Agile scrum process and planning poker with Arreche&rsquo;s great Slack voting app. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to be able to support the students but it does come with a cost, and it&rsquo;s pretty rare that university students who participate as part of an assignment will come back to contribute further, although perhaps I&rsquo;m seeing the world without rose-tinted glasses today.  I feel a negative haze on my vision at the moment.  Nasty cough almost gone but dragging into a third week, beating myself up about subbing decisions when coaching the weekend football game, feeling like I should be able to awaken to the moment and drop the illusion on the self.  Scrabbling for grants for tiny amounts of money.  Working really hard but not earning any money.  </p>

<p>At least I&rsquo;m feeling calmer - I&rsquo;m not expecting AgileVentures to generate enough funds to support my family and I think we&rsquo;re doing some great work.  The under-populated &ldquo;Kent Beck&rdquo; scrums are filling up as I associated a different project kick-off with each.  Also affecting my mood is rejection from Pragmatic Programmers on my book draft on &ldquo;Agile Methods for Open Source Projects&rdquo;.  I put a fair amount of effort to get what was originally a short chapter up to 5000 words.  I know that publishing a book is no ticket to financial stability, but it&rsquo;s one additional route to push out the AgileVentures methodology.  There&rsquo;s a model of how a loose and flexible Agile Scrum process can help Open Source projects grow and maintain quality, and for a while I was thinking a book on the subject might be the way to get it across, but perhaps we just need to bake it in to the user experience of AgileVentures.</p>

<p>Graghh!  I just want to code and scrum and generate systems for clients and work with them to understand if it&rsquo;s really helping fix their problems, and I want to do it in an open fashion that allows everyone else in the world to see the process and join in.  I get to do that a little in AgileVentures, but increasingly my time is spent scrabbling for funding, and if we don&rsquo;t land something soon I&rsquo;m going to have to kick my paid job/contract search into a much higher gear.  </p>

<p>Bringing this back round to scrums, it was interesting that some new folks had difficulty even getting into Slack to vote on the stories with us.  They were using Slack via the web.  It&rsquo;s funny for me with the desktop app installed, navigating to a Slack channel is trivial, but there&rsquo;s a learning curve.  Even with a direct link to the relevant Slack channel in the chat in the hangout, one person got all tangled up trying to type out that link rather than clicking it, and several folks were stymied trying to work out how to join the channel on the spur of the moment.  The voting interface was present, but they had to click the green &ldquo;join channel&rdquo; button that Slack adds to take you from the preview mode to really entering the channel and the voting interace coming live.  That old beginner vs expert UX divide.   We got everyone voting in the end, but being able to see other folks experience via screen share in Google hangouts is eye opening as always.</p>

<p>Clearly voting plugged directly into the Hangout would be better - gosh I wish the hangout could embed the Slack chat itself and those joining the hangout would be automatically in that chat.  Maybe with some new YouTube live interface, or if we switch to Zoom or roll our own after April 25th.  The visions of the interfaces that would work still dance in my head, but I can&rsquo;t seem to command the resources to put them together in the quality that I imagine &hellip; maybe one day.</p>
