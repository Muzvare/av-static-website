        <h5 class='date'>28 Mar 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="design sprint" src="/images/design_sprint.png" /></p>

<p>So I was heading into London for the second day in a row to continue our impromptu design sprint with the Healthy London Partnership (HLP).  According to the Google Ventures book on the subject, &ldquo;Day One&rdquo; of a design sprint consists of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Set long term goal</li>
<li>[ ] List sprint questions</li>
<li>[ ] Make a map</li>
<li>[ ] Ask the experts</li>
<li>[ ] Generate &ldquo;How Might We &hellip;?&rdquo; notes</li>
<li>[ ] Organise notes</li>
<li>[ ] Vote on notes</li>
<li>[ ] Pick target</li>
</ul>

<p>This sequence of events is designed to fit in a period from 10:00am to 4:30pm on a single day with a few breaks and an hour for lunch.  Actually there&rsquo;s a fair bit of preparation before you can get started on day one:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Choose a big challenge</li>
<li>[ ] Get a Decider</li>
<li>[ ] Recruit a Sprint Team</li>
<li>[ ] Schedule extra Experts</li>
<li>[ ] Pick a facilitator</li>
<li>[ ] Block off five calendar days for whole team</li>
<li>[ ] Book a room with two whiteboards</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge had already been set, of trying to increase the chances that Social Prescription and Self Care programs would be rolled out in many locations in London to benefit the health of individuals and communities while helping to control the rising cost of healthcare.  The team lead, who I&rsquo;d met on Friday was the decider, but he was extraordinarily busy, and so had appointed his change manager as his delegate.  It wasn&rsquo;t realistic to grab a full week of anyone else&rsquo;s time, so the sprint team was going to be the change manager and myself, as facilitator.  If we were doing a Sprint by the book, we&rsquo;d have more people involved for the week and would have scheduled extra experts to be available to talk to on the Monday, but this was all at short notice and we were planning and doing in quick succession.  The change manager had reached out to people via email on Friday, and already had interest from 8 different people, but they were going to be a mixed bag of people who could talk either only on the phone or people who could come to the HLP offices in person.</p>

<p>I suggested that we try and split folks into experts and testers, and those who were only available electronically would give expert input at the beginning of the week, while those who could come in person could test the prototypes that we would generate by the end of the week.  We had a room with two whiteboards, but there was information we couldn&rsquo;t rub off on one, and the wrong kinds of pens, so ultimately we ended up going with sheets of A3 paper as we tried to knock off as much of day one as possible.</p>

<p><img alt="Long Term Goal" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4tkxujc3bd75w25/long_term_goal_image.jpg?dl=1" /></p>

<p>Our long term goal didn&rsquo;t boil down into a wonderfully pithy statement, but the change manager and I seemed to be speaking the same language about what the project might want to achieve.</p>

<p>We generated two pages of &ldquo;how might we fail&rdquo; notes:</p>

<p><img alt="How we might fail (1)" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iaty72ys9211fe2/how_might_we_fail_one_image.jpg?dl=1" />
<img alt="How we might fail (2)" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wen8yxuct4wq5tw/how_might_we_fail_two_image.jpg?dl=1" /></p>

<p>I was doing a lot of writing, and the change manager was throwing out lots of ideas - I was adding mine in too.  We had the cart a little before the horse in the sense that we were already stacked towards thinking about a wiki solution that was proposed in the project tender, but either way I was definitely improving my understanding of how Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) worked within the NHS in order to allocate resources for healthcare.  </p>

<p>We moved on to map-making, identifying key stakeholders.  The first map had a lot:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patient (&amp; Carer)</li>
<li>Commissioner</li>
<li>HLP Researcher</li>
<li>HLP Implementor</li>
<li>Patient Champion</li>
<li>Community Resource Provider</li>
<li>Social Prescription Service provider</li>
<li>G.P.s (General Practitioners &ndash;&gt; U.K. doctors)</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="First Stakeholder Map" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgicpsrce70xfze/map_one_image.jpg?dl=1" /> </p>

<p>Which we pruned back in a second version:</p>

<p><img alt="Second Stakeholder Map" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/62v1nl8vjb7ktva/map_two_image.jpg?dl=1" /></p>

<p>We identified the key component of the point of influencing the commissioners, and dove in deeper on that in another map that focused on just an HLP researcher and the commissioner as stakeholders, and what it would take to have the commissioner become aware of the material, absorb information from it and then actually take action:</p>

<p><img alt="HLP Researcher and Commissioner Map" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pslia27srgxazwg/map_three_image.jpg?dl=1" /> </p>

<p>Then we ended up with a fourth diagram assuming that other stakeholders could participate in the creation of the materials, which pulled in another Stakeholder - a moderator:</p>

<p><img alt="Extended Commissioner influence Map" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fjvqqyqb906v5q9/map_four_image.jpg?dl=1" /> </p>

<p>Brendan and I seemed to be making good progress, at least in terms of me better understanding the complexities of the interactions between the different stakeholders.  Given a stronger sprint structure we would now have our experts on tap to come in and be interviewed, talked through our high level goals, notes on how we might fail and associated maps.  However we were still in the process of booking our experts, and our time in the room had ended, so we called that a day.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon catching up with email, and putting out feelers for legal advice on the project&rsquo;s terms &amp; conditions.  I&rsquo;d like to have digitalised all the notes and maps, but there wasn&rsquo;t time, and the big question going in for day two was how were we going to fit the different components of the design sprint into the rest of the week.  Should we split day one over two days? Jump straight to day two?  Find out what we did in tomorrow&rsquo;s blog! :-)</p>
