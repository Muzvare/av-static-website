    <p><img alt="sprinting" src="/images/day.jpg" /></p>

<p>Day by day I&rsquo;m getting one item off my desk.  I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s so painful.  Over the last 10 days I&rsquo;ve got off new passport applications for myself and my eldest son, sent off tax liability statements for the AgileVentures bank, and put various bank statements and odd pieces of papers in either the bin or my new filing cabinet.  Is it possible to enjoy the process more?  It&rsquo;s a great feeling when one of these administrivia tasks is completed.  A lovely feeling of progress as the surface of my desk slowly re-appears.  Managed to get straight to the blog this morning despite tweeting and slacking a GreaterThanCode episode.  It was almost as if the volume of Slack alerts (25) kept me on the straight and narrow.  Gosh, why is so much of this stuff like pulling teeth! :-)</p>

<p>My daily routines continue; writing out Kanji tests for my kids while eating breakfast, walking them to school, listening to podcasts on the way back, tweet/slacking them (the podcasts, not the kids), blogging ~ the day ~ getting the kids to bed, reviewing older blogs and pushing to Slack, Medium and LinkedIn.  Looking back at older blogs, I&rsquo;m missing the more intense coding of last year, missing blogs with more code samples; not that I&rsquo;m sure if anyone other than me derives any benefit from them.  I&rsquo;m starting to get a few more likes on Medium and LinkedIn, getting a few interesting conversations on Slack, but my consciousness is changing.  I&rsquo;m watching more, seeing how the experience from my senses interleaves with memories, feelings, short excerpt from movies and tv shows.  What is this extraordinary one mind that can leap from considering the scale of the universe, to the inside of an atom, to the rage at a failing relationship, to the bitter sweet joy of nostalgia, to the peace of satisfaction!</p>

<p>We all have it (I think), the mind?  Or should we just say the experience of reality?  The ever-runnning flow of experience; attention slipping from sensations in the body, focus on something in the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; world.  If ever anything is truly &ldquo;outside&rdquo; or &ldquo;inside&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m starting to be able to watch as the emotions rise.  Yesterday my eldest son injured his left arm during his evening football training.  It seemed to become more painful as he got closer to bedtime, and there was fair amount of work with painkillers, ice-packs etc. I think it this morning that I was on the stairs calling up to his room to ask him which arm he had injured as I was considering whether he needed the day off school.  I asked him &ldquo;right arm?&rdquo; and he responded indicating that he didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about.  He was changing in his room, I was on the stairs, and irritation welled up overtaking my experience.  The irritation was a sort of disbelief that my 12 year old son couldn&rsquo;t understand the question, couldn&rsquo;t understand the context.  My tone changed and I said with some tension &ldquo;the arm you injured last night, was it the right arm or the left arm&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Left arm&rdquo; came the reply.  Why should I be irritated?  There, at some level, I&rsquo;m sort of expecting my son to be on the same train of thought as me.  But why should he?  Why should anybody?</p>

<p>I feel like I can go further.  I&rsquo;m still not quite observing the irritation (or other emotion) just as it rises.  It&rsquo;s still slightly after the fact and then it&rsquo;s kind of damage repair to make myself calm again.  My kids tell me I&rsquo;m less angry than I used to be.  I feel like I&rsquo;m on the edge of grasping something important here.  I&rsquo;d meant to blog about the components of my day; take another look at where I can find some time savings.  Maybe there&rsquo;s time for a little of that.  The blogging process has simplified as a result of reviewing it last year, with me creating a branch in the github UI, navigating to the correct directory, editing in the browser, submitting a PR.  Could be simpler, but still pretty smooth.  What else was in yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>09:30 - 10:00 - accidental Slack and Email review</li>
<li>10:00 - 10:30 - blogging</li>
<li>10:30 - 11:30 - composing a report about AgileVentures situation</li>
<li>11:30 - 11:45 - Scrum</li>
<li>11:45 - 13:30 - working through todo list (pushing out WSO code to staging, phone call with potential funder, phone call with charity trustee, managing new Premiums and sponsorships)</li>
<li>14:00 - 14:30 - lunch and reviewing &ldquo;Confident Ruby&rdquo; sections for mob programming session</li>
<li>15:00 - 15:45 - Skype with potential sponsor/partner</li>
<li>15:45 - 16:00 - Scrum and Redeemify project code review</li>
<li>16:00 - 17:00 - Ruby Mob</li>
<li>18:00 - 19:00 - fixing elasticmail/mailchimp settings and writing draft proposal for funder</li>
<li>21:00 - 21:30 - reviewing old blogs, pushing to medium/linkedin - Slack catch up</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure where I can squeeze much more efficiency out of all that.  I guess the difficult thing is that applying for funding and reaching out to sponsors takes up time.  Maybe we can get to the point where the mobs stop being review of book chapters and actually generating new code on community challenges.  We had a new Premium sign up yesterday and got two new folks sponsored.  There&rsquo;s a lot of coding we could do to smooth that process up, but right now I have to switch to coding/working on things that bring in money immediately, not things that might speculatively bring more money in in the future.  I&rsquo;ll still keep taking it day by day, and seeing if I can enjoy the experience, moment by moment &hellip;</p>
