<p>The last two days have been blog driven NHS wiki flurries in the morning followed by mobbing and AgileVenturing in the afternoon.  In the Elixir mob on Wednesday we made further headway into Phoenix and I really start to question whether we&rsquo;ve all been suffering through an instance variable nightmare.  Yesterday I caught up with the marketing team, the Ruby mob (where we got confident with some of our legacy code) and then spent an hour bashing away at AsyncVoter&rsquo;s Azure/Dokku setup with Matt and Raphael.</p>

<p>I think there are certain critical things that I need to do upfront this morning, i.e. as part of the blogging process, and some others that need to be done before lunch.  At the end of yesterday I was starting to feel calmer that we were bringing together all the things we needed for the NHS wiki project.  I&rsquo;d emailed all the remaining stakeholders for additional meetings, the HLP team was getting the training dates set, I&rsquo;d made an outline of the training materials, and we&rsquo;d made contact with the Communications team.  Furthermore we&rsquo;d also worked with the trustees to get the paperwork done for me to be paid this month, so that&rsquo;s a relief.  The key things that need to happen before lunch today are then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process my payment</li>
<li>Reach out to the HLP communication team (as main contact is off sick)</li>
<li>Reply to NHS/Voluntary Sector stakeholder emails to confirm meetings for the week after next</li>
<li>Reach out to enterprise wellness related to moderation</li>
</ul>

<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking that the first two have to be knocked off quickly. However in even trying to reach out to the HLP communications team I got lost in LinkedIn for 10 minutes reviewing the HLP organistaion there and connecting up to the NHS staff I&rsquo;ve already met.  That was helpful, but (reality check) I&rsquo;ve got to process this payment for my own personal finances.  It should be simple, but anything done for the first time can encounter issues, so let me just pause the blog to get that done &hellip; done - had to do a text authorisation on my mobile, but couldn&rsquo;t have taken more than a minute in total.  I also see that the NHS payment for the first part of our work came through, so that&rsquo;s a relief to have that all sorted.  I think my heart-rate has slowed slightly :-)</p>

<p>Now I have to think about how best to communicate with the communications team &hellip; an email to all the contacts, or a separate email to each one &hellip;?  I demurred from emailing the three contact emails I had separately, and decided to email all three, cc-ing my existing contacts.  There&rsquo;s a danger that asking a group of people that everyone assumes that someone else can deal with it.  Here&rsquo;s a draft of the email I sent:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Sorry to email you out of the blue, but I'm working with NAME and NAME in HLP, and our charity AgileVentures is developing the new HLP Social Prescription wiki.

I met with NAME to discuss last week and everything is looking good.

This week I was following up with NAME about a URL subdomain for our wiki, but unfortunately NAME is off sick and I was wondering if you, or someone else on your team might be able to help us out. We're planning for a soft launch on May 4th and a hard launch on May 12th so we're on a bit of a short fuse.

One piece of feedback we've had from many stakeholders is that any new wiki system should not be a "new" location, so we were hoping to set up a subdomain under the http://healthylondon.org domain, e.g.

http://wiki.healthylondon.org

We assume that someone in your communications team, or some of your sub-contracted developers, will control the domain name records for healthylondon.org, and would be able to set up the "wiki" subdomain to point to our system.

Please let me know if any of you might be able to help with this, or if you could put us in touch with whichever controls the domain name.
</code></pre>
<p>I did add delivery tracking and a return receipt.  Some might consider a return receipt a little aggressive, but there&rsquo;s a time crunch here and I&rsquo;m hoping to quickly get to the person who can help us with this sub-domain, or discover that we can&rsquo;t have a sub-domain ASAP.  So sending a group email with a &ldquo;return receipt&rdquo; request was my middle ground.</p>

<p>So with that done I should double check that the funds got transfered from before &hellip; and it has. Yay! So while I&rsquo;m in that bank interface I should update things for the new tax year &hellip; and &hellip; that&rsquo;s all done. Phew.  So that let&rsquo;s me check a few more outstanding things off my todo lists.  So now I need to send out an email to Enterprise Wellness to find a good time for a phone call.</p>

<p>It pains me that blogs about what we did in the Elixir and Ruby mobs this week might be more interesting to the coders among this blogs readership, and to you I apologise, but I&rsquo;ve got to feed my kids, and that&rsquo;s what the NHS contract is enabling at the moment.  If you&rsquo;re really, really keen to have more blogs about how Elixir is changing the programming world, and how Ruby gets confident, then vote with your wallet.  Sign up for AgileVentures Premium Mob membership (if you haven&rsquo;t already) and get your friends, family and neighbours to do so as well! :-)  In the meantime it&rsquo;ll probably be more blogs about communication and mediawiki. Sorry &hellip;</p>
