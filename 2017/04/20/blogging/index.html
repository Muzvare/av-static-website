        <h5 class='date'>20 Apr 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="blogging" src="/images/blog.jpg" /></p>

<p>Blogging helps me get my thoughts straight in the morning.  Well, I say blogging&ndash;I&rsquo;m just doing the morning pages exercise that some writers apparently use.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any particular requirement to blog them; but it&rsquo;s somehow painful for me not to publish whatever I&rsquo;m generating.  That&rsquo;s maybe part of my problem, in that I suspect that I might connect with more folks if I spent more time revising and polishing before sharing, but who knows?  I got some good feedback off the <a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/03/17/private-pairing/">blog post</a> I shared in Slack last night.  At the moment I&rsquo;m trying to hold the course till June when I&rsquo;ll have been compulsively blogging for a year.  I&rsquo;ve previously thought that after that I might switch to one blog a week. In the shower this morning I thought about whether it would be interesting to do one private pairing session a day rather than blogging.  I&rsquo;ve also had an idea that maybe a series of pair programming videos with relatively well-known programmers might be fun and help towards the vision of a more active pair programming community.</p>

<p>So I just had a strange brain fork (or trident?) experience where my mind went in three different directions at almost the same time - or at least kept switching back and forth between three or more different topics.  Partly there&rsquo;s this process before blogging in the morning where I start to think about what I want to blog about, and then sometimes I sit down and the text goes off in a different direction, and sometimes I want to go with the flow, and sometimes I can&rsquo;t bear to leave things out.  On this occasion I couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave anything out and so I make four sets of notes in draft below that I now plan to turn into four separate paragraphs - here are (hopefully) those four paragraphs:</p>

<p>On the subject of compulsive blogging, I was relieved to hear <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/podcast/episode-016-julia-evans/">Julia Evans talking on GreaterThanCode</a> about how she <a href="https://jvns.ca/">blogs intensively</a> on all sorts of tech topics, and makes me feel that I&rsquo;m not such an insane blogging hermit that I sometimes deride myself internally for.  Looking over her blogs like <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/08/05/pair-programming-is-amazing-except-when-its-not/">&ldquo;Pair programming is amazing! Except&hellip; when it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</a> I see a higher quality that I can aspire to. </p>

<p>After blogging, myself, about <a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/03/17/private-pairing/">private pairing sessions</a> I wondered if after June I should spend my blogging time on private pairing.  I&rsquo;m currently spending over an hour on blog activities each day with at least 30 minutes writing in the morning (plus research) and then another 30 in the evening (reviewing a blog from one month back to push to AV nonprofit site and AV slack, and one blog from 3 months back to push to Medium, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn).  Of course private pairing sessions wouldn&rsquo;t include videos to blog, but perhaps I could tweet who I was pairing with?  To be honest I&rsquo;d prefer to spend almost all my day blogging and pairing with different folks, private, public and everywhere in-between.  In some ways, I&rsquo;m on a mission to work out a framework that will allow that activity to feed my kids as well, although I am really enjoying design sprints and talking to clients.  Design sprints online, now there&rsquo;s a thought &hellip;</p>

<p>But anyway, if I want to be blogging about pairing sessions in more detail, one model could be to reach out to well-known programmers and produce a series of video blogs more like 
<a href="https://www.driftingruby.com/">https://www.driftingruby.com/</a>, <a href="https://sub.watchmecode.net/">https://sub.watchmecode.net/</a> or <a href="https://scaleyourcode.com/">https://scaleyourcode.com/</a>&rsquo;s interviews with experts.  All of these seem much more accessible and polished than the blizzard of adhoc pairing sessions we&rsquo;ve recorded at AgileVentures.  Maybe we just need a load of venture capital to build the perfect system to support the different levels of public and private pairing?  Of course we&rsquo;re a charity &hellip; perhaps there&rsquo;s a venture philanthropist out there who can help us make it happen? :-)  Or is it just too much to try and build a new social-technical collaboration framework AND try and direct its engine towards charitable goals?</p>

<p>Of course the orphaned blog topic that I had wanted to get into today was the great Elixir mobbing session that we had yesterday.  I&rsquo;d been away for a week, and was really pleased to see the mob continue in my absence and the team get Elixir Phoenix set up on C9.  We carried on through Stephen Grider&rsquo;s Phoenix tutorial and completed a new route and controller.  The mobbing is private, and only for AgileVentures Premium Mob members.  Of course my internal extrovert just wants to share everything including the videos, but part of AgileVentures&rsquo; sustainability is trying to create something that folks will put down some money for so we can ultimately pay staff to cover the gaps that appear when volunteers turn over.  AgileVentures Premium F2F is private pairing sessions, although I&rsquo;ve tried to make that all about working on AgileVentures open source charity projects.  Maybe that needs to change? Or the pairing community should be at least slighltly de-coupled from the charity projects?  It&rsquo;s agonising.  People are so much more comfortable pairing privately on their own projects, but there&rsquo;s so much great learning for them and for others if they paired publicly on charity projects.  I guess the trick will be to build a nice pathway from one to the other that people can move along at their preferred pace &hellip;</p>

<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;ll keep blogging &hellip;</p>
