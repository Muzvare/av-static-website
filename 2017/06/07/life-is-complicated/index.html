        <h5 class='date'> 7 Jun 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="life is complicated" src="/images/life_is_complicated.png" /></p>

<p>Well no surprise to anyone, but life appears to be rather complex :-) I try to listen to a tech podcast daily to keep up with techworld and I just listened to <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/podcast/episode-020-jenn-schiffer/">Jenn Schiffer on &ldquo;&gt;Code&rdquo;</a> which was a fascinating episode.  Of the many and complex thoughts it spurred, here are two:</p>

<ol>
<li>I try to blog honestly and thoughtfully every work day, but I know I still hold loads back for fear of offence or creating difficult to manage situations</li>
<li>personality cult vs open source - I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to miss bad press about the personalities of Linus Torvalds, Eric S. Raymond etc.  I&rsquo;m so impressed with linux/git that it&rsquo;s complicated to hear that Linus &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t a good person&rdquo;.  Less so with ESR, but I&rsquo;ve been pointing people to read <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em> for many years &hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>I think we could definitely do with a lot less hero worship, but I wonder who gets to decide who is and isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;good person&rdquo;?  I guess if people are on record making certain sorts of statements that&rsquo;s one thing, but I wonder what makes someone fundamentally good or fundamentally bad?  I asked all these questions in the &ldquo;&gt;Code&rdquo; Slack and already I&rsquo;m kind of worried if I&rsquo;m going to have stepped over a line and have rubbed people up the wrong way.</p>

<p>Other things making my brain twist and turn include the camera light on my macbook being stuck on, making me think of the continual cameras in Orwell&rsquo;s <em>1984.</em>  I think I will probably have to reboot the computer to fix it, which takes up a chunk of time to manage all the open stuff on my computer.  I also had a potential Premium member enquiring about how our AgileVentures professional development support works (I accidentally looked at my email before blogging) which is great, but my reply seems to have bounced with:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s unclear is whether the email will have been delivered with a flag, or will have bounced.  It&rsquo;s worrying because maybe that means that the email I last sent to LaunchCode about collaboration didn&rsquo;t get through.  I&rsquo;m fairly sure many of my emails do get through.  I&rsquo;ve previously emailed Gandi (my domain hoster) about this, but they haven&rsquo;t responded.  Might it be my email client?  I need to reboot anyway, so time to upgrade my Thunderbird client I guess.</p>

<p>I also find that the non-profit discount that we&rsquo;re getting on Hootsuite is 50% rather than 100% - my mistake.  So now we&rsquo;re committed to Â£40 a month for something that I&rsquo;m not sure we actually need.  I guess we can cancel, but this is something that the marketing folks are interested in having.  Hootsuite (which I don&rsquo;t know well) appears to allow you to set up a Social Media posting plan and sending tweets and facebook posts and things to a branded social media account.  We were introduced to Hootsuite by a Premium member who&rsquo;s been volunteering on the marketing team.  We also now have two marketing interns and several other members regularly attending our twice-weekly marketing meetings.</p>

<p>There are lots of things going on under the purview of marketing, including the new monthly newsletter, these social media posting plans, promoting our Agile Book Club podcast, to name a few, as well as trying to work out how to make our websites better communicate what we do.  I&rsquo;m totally convinced that we can&rsquo;t succeed without the right communication, but I&rsquo;m also confused about the value of something like a social media posting plan.  I also worry that questioning the value of it might offend some people, and/or be interpreted as me quashing their ideas.  As a senior AV member it seems that my opinions carry a lot of weight, and I have to be careful about expressing a lack of enthusiasm for a particular approach or direction.</p>

<p>This was something that came up in the context of the MakersAcademy bootcamp where we talked about how CEO&rsquo;s of companies might not realise they were always seen as carrying a couple of pistols.  There&rsquo;s apparently this idea that junior people will sometimes silently throw out their ideas and initiatives if they perceive a senior person is not enthusiastic about something.  It maybe follows that this is a particularly serious issue in volunteer organisations where coming across as negative about a particular idea might lead a volunteer to completely give up and not volunteer their time in the future.  Now of course I don&rsquo;t imagine anyone is going to complain if I say we can&rsquo;t allocate financial budget to something, but why should that be any different to temporal budget, i.e. hours spent on something?  I guess that&rsquo;s where measurement comes in.  Perhaps I should be relying far less on my intuition about what is and isn&rsquo;t an effective approach; embrace all approaches, whatever I think of them, and focus on helping whoever suggests the approaches to get involved in measuring their effectiveness &hellip;</p>

<p>One thread of complexity that links some of these topics together is that when I reviewed the first Social Media posting plan, I suggested replacing posts including quotes of Mark Zuckerberg with quotes from open source luminaries like Linus Torvalds, ESR and David Heinemeier Hansson.  Posting quotes from Facebook&rsquo;s founder made me feel nervous, because of my misgivings about the facebook system, partly arising from me being hacked on there a few years back, and news stories about the algorithms facebook employs to adjust what you see, and posts from FreeCodeCamps&rsquo; Quincy Larson and a sort of general feeling of unease that I get when I look at a facebook feed mixing updates and images from friends and family with adverts for products whose values I question.</p>

<p>Now the &gt;Code podcast is giving me pause for thought about some of these open source luminaries and even the idea that we should be promoting &ldquo;famous&rdquo; individuals.  I mean the whole concept of the social media posting plan seems rather artificial to me.  I would much rather be having posts about individuals in our organisation, or from individuals in our organisation about what they thought and they were doing.  As I understand it, the social media posting plan is about brand building.  Other brands are regularly posting on social media, so we need to do so as well in order to compete?   Is it dangerous to express concerns since that will demotivate people to try things?  I guess I come back to trying to focus on the measurement process.  But then sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to measure and take time to measure, so in the meantime you try to use your intuition. I&rsquo;m tying myself in knots &hellip; life does indeed appear complicated :-)</p>
