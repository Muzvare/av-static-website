<p>So I&rsquo;m heading south of the river again for an NHS meeting - I&rsquo;ve just typed up my draft marketing/moderation report and got it into a PDF format that I can share with the NHS folks.  I&rsquo;ve forgotten the bloody dongle I need for the old style projectors - will have to order a spare one of those to leave in my bag.</p>

<p>Main thing I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this week is my own reactions to two emotionally charged interactions on Slack. I have always found difficult social interactions terribly sticky in my mind, i.e. I keep reviewing the same thing over and over again.  I particularly remember working at the University of Hawaii when my eldest son was about two years old and lying awake at midnight reliving interactions with the head of department over and over in my head.  There&rsquo;s also been a partial pattern of coming into conflict with people when I join new organisations, at least I have a memory of a pattern and difficult (and mentally sticky) interactions with people when I started work at Toshiba; at an internet startup in Tokyo, when starting at the University of Hawaii.  I think I recognised that pattern and learnt from it, although it&rsquo;s longer ago now and as we go back twenty years or so I can&rsquo;t remember whether the particular interactions were quite so sticky before I moved to Hawaii over ten years ago.</p>

<p>At least for me, whenever I have an emotionally charged disagreement with someone I find myself dwelling on it repeatedly.  I think I&rsquo;ve slowly improved in my handling of these things, but I&rsquo;m still not sure that I&rsquo;m being as effective as I might.  The two particularly emotionally charged interactions this week were with two AgileVentures members on Slack.  One is a premium member and the other is a free-tier member.  The Premium member got rather angry about a meeting cancelled at the last minute.  I think I reacted in reasonably apologetic tones, but I think my attempt at an explanation lead to more anger.  A follow up post from that individual (I&rsquo;m worried to mention names for fear of further inflaming things) left me reeling in a very highly charged emotional state.  In the past I might have responded directly in Slack, but in a hopefully more sensible approach I wrote out my feelings in a text document, and responded later to the individual that I had heard what they said, and let them know I had written a long response and offered to share that, or possibly to meet in order to talk face to face.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s a better way to go and as it happened a podcast with Erin Flynn the next day gave similar advice.  Still I was frustrated at the strength of my feelings and I spent an hour on writing them up.  In the process I think I definitely did understand the person&rsquo;s point of view better, but also strengthened my own feelings that they are over-reacting to a degree.  While writing that out may have addressed my immediate highly intense feelings it has not stopped me from visiting and re-visiting the interaction repeatedly over the subsequent days.</p>

<p>On reflection it feels that my attempt at an explanation did not help and merely fanned the flames.  In deep irony that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m always telling my children - get that apology in, and wait for the person to calm down before trying to explain.  Erin Flynn was saying focus on saying that you are sorry the person feels the way they do, but do not apologise for your actions, per se.  At least (I assume) that you are in a place where you can decide that&rsquo;s appropriate, rather than just doing it reactively.</p>

<p>I have more examples of how the apology/reaction can backfire.  The most difficult thing for me however is the unpleasant sensation that it all creates for me repeatedly over the next few days;  waking up in the morning, last thing at night.  A mental movie plays in my head of the interaction.  How can I describe it? I re-experience the interaction over again and the same strong emotions come up.  What are those emotions?  A feeling of embarrassment of not having handled the interaction correctly.  A feeling of anger towards the person for directing anger at me.  There&rsquo;s a kind of revulsion, a desire to just stop thinking about this thing that appears to have me re-living unpleasant emotions again and again when I would rather be focusing on other things.</p>

<p>All the Buddhist/awakening stuff seems to suggest that it is helpful to simply observe the emotions; to try and be present in the body. I try to do that but often get caught up again in the unpleasant emotions and find myself overwhelmed with a desire that the unpleasant emotions would stop.  That can often lead to more feelings of anger towards the person involved in the initial interaction, and so the cycle continues.</p>

<p>At HPU it tended to be the students who I would occasionally have challenging interactions with, more than the staff, but that was possibly due to me working remotely from the other side of the world.  At MakersAcademy there were some tricky interactions with students, but it was ultimately the staff interactions that were hardest.  I can remember being overwhelmed with frustration at the actions of one individual and being repeatedley consumed by reliving my feelings about my interaction with them all through a family weekend. I ended up writing a short essay on it all.  Sharing that with the person then seemed to end up backfiring as they said they had felt be-littled by it.  I didn&rsquo;t find that out till much later though.  I was busy trying to honestly share my feelings on our interaction and when they suggested sharing with the rest of the team I happily did so.  The team&rsquo;s reaction seemed to be that I was attacking this one individual.  There it all seemed to be complicated by the fact that I was in a position of some authority.</p>

<p>Looking back at that situation it seems like I should have shared my short essay with some of the other senior team members before going to the individual in question.  I&rsquo;m still shocked by how it all seemed to blow up in my face.  I&rsquo;m now on good terms with the individual in question, but I still regret how it all turned out.  The individual in question had come across as a very confident assertive individual.  However the interaction with the essay was a traumatic one because I was someone in a position of authority.  I was approaching the situation as one where equals would be discussing how they interacted with each other.</p>

<p>There was another occasion when I had a prolonged interaction on Slack with a student about their decision to leave MakersAcademy.  They were being very critical of our course in what I felt was a logically incoherent fashion.  I&rsquo;d been working hard to reach out and try and help the student stay on the course.  I shared my Slack interaction with the team in the interests of transparency and ultimately I don&rsquo;t think it was too my benefit.  There&rsquo;s a convincing argument to be made that I was just continuing an academic debate with the student far past the point that it was constructive.  I&rsquo;m not sure.  I certainly didn&rsquo;t feel very good about it.  It was very mentally sticky, and my openness and transparency about the interaction didn&rsquo;t seem to have any positive consequences that I can see, other than to garner the feedback that it wasn&rsquo;t a very productive conversation, which I kind of knew already.</p>

<p>Subsequently I have occasionally had very mentally sticky interactions at AgileVentures.  One of the key senior people appeared to get very angry and withdrew themselves from interaction with the organisation.  That particular individual often expressed themselves in what I found as very aggressive terms.  The final straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back appeared to be me not responding in Slack. I had made a somewhat reactive comment to something they said, but then didn&rsquo;t want to engage in further discussion.  I relive that over and over again.  The individual subsequently wrote up a long list of their grievances, and I avoided responding to it directly.  Learning from my Makers Academy experience I wrote up my responses separately and shared them with two other senior team members, got feedback, polished etc., but by the time I was ready to post the individual in question had archived the discussion and it seemed like my input wasn&rsquo;t being waited for, or necessarily needed.</p>

<p>Maybe I should be digging out that response and sending it over to put my own demons to bed?  The timing seems wrong.  My sense is that individual is calmer as a result of having been able to write out how they felt.  I strongly disagree with many of their assertions and feel they were being unreasonable, demanding and unfair.  I relive those emotions with what I hope is gradually decreasing frequency.  More recently I have been writing up separate responses to someone who regularly engages in intense debate on the AgileVentures Slack, but I haven&rsquo;t posted them back and in that case I don&rsquo;t seem to be reliving things so much.  I still think their logic is deeply flawed, but I&rsquo;ve stopped believing that trying to convince them of my point of view has much merit.</p>

<p>So that brings us back to this week.  I&rsquo;ve already talked about the first interaction where I&rsquo;ve written up my response and have held off posting it.  The stickiness and unpleasantness of that interaction is vying for time in my head with another unpleasant interaction that came up later in the same day, this time with a non-premium member.  This individual had been upset on several occasions about their code (pull requests) being ignored.  I had said (as I often do on those occasions) that one option was to upgrade to Premium membership to get priority code reviews.  There was also a long running infrastructure issue on that project that I felt needed addressing first.  The individual had said they couldn&rsquo;t afford the Premium membership and I had mentioned the possibility of sponsorship.  A week later and seemingly out of the blue (to me) the individual expressed that they were insulted by being asked for money to review their code and the offer of sponsorship and wanted to leave the project and AgileVentures.  I said that I was sorry that they felt that way, but that was great feedback and thanked them for it.  I also mentioned that I didn&rsquo;t think I had asked them for money to review their code, but I guess I was splitting hairs; but I couldn&rsquo;t help myself.  It felt like a nasty accusation and I needed to defend myself.</p>

<p>The more immediate consequence was that we engaged in a repeated back and forth in which we told each other a lot more about each other&rsquo;s feelings.  It felt like quite a heated argument.  I&rsquo;m sure neither of us felt very good.  Ironically it&rsquo;s the former interaction with the Premium member that&rsquo;s proving much stickier.  The non-premium member then surprised me by turning up in the planning meeting for the project, being very civil, taking on tasks etc. when I just thought they&rsquo;d said they were leaving.  So confusing.  I really give up. I don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is to do with all this.</p>

<p>Is it really the case that you just shouldn&rsquo;t respond to anyone&rsquo;s assertions about yourself?  Is defending yourself just a way to get into an unpleasant fight?  Should one listen and not respond and always take a week before responding, even if that means you give no response?</p>
