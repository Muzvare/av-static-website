        <h5 class='date'>20 Jun 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="design sprint" src="/images/design_sprint.png" /></p>

<p>So Friday morning was fairly frantic.  I&rsquo;d gone to sleep thinking that the last day testing of the design sprint had been postponed, and woke to find we were &ldquo;game on&rdquo; with testers booked into slots and a half-finished prototype that needed completing by noon my time.  Quick AgileVentures trustee meeting out of the way and I was working away in illustrator to finish the rest of the interactive popups.</p>

<p>I was getting the hang of illustrator layers and didn&rsquo;t have too much trouble extracting the rest of the images we had downloaded from ShutterStock and getting things set up.  What was immediately clear was that we couldn&rsquo;t get away with a background image with popups being displayed over the top.  There was a noticeable delay in that background loading so what we had was a sequence of main images like so:</p>

<p><img alt="all screens from the prototype" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uglnko00ybpwalu/Screenshot%202017-06-20%2009.25.02.png?dl=1" /></p>

<p>and used InVision hotspots to link them together so that it appeared that you got a popup when you clicked on the relevant part of the image.  We were ready with time to spare and I was able to review the videos of the GV test sessions and re-read the sections of the design sprint book that outline a five-act interview, which we modified ever so slightly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Friendly welcome: </p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome the customer and put him or her at ease. </li>
<li>Explain that you’re looking for candid feedback.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Context questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with easy small talk, then transition to questions about the topic you’re trying to learn about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Introduce the prototype:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remind the customer that some things might not work, and that you’re not testing him or her. </li>
<li>Ask the customer to think aloud.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks and nudges: </p>

<ul>
<li>Watch the customer figure out the prototype on his or her own. Start with a simple nudge. </li>
<li>Ask follow-up questions to help the customer think aloud.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Debrief:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask questions that prompt the customer to summarize. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Finally: </p>

<ul>
<li>thank the customer</li>
<li>ask about sharing video for training and education purposes</li>
<li>say gift card will be taken care of by colleague</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;d been volunteered as the interviewer, and while Matt ran a separate hangout for the rest of the team, I set up individual hangouts for the testers so we could record and stream separately.  Federico was working furiously in the background managing the screening spreadsheet to identify individuals in the target demographic.  Basically it all went off pretty well.  One individual tester was a no show, and we couldn&rsquo;t get any backups in time, so we only had four sessions.  The second tester found the cursor key navigation was still on so we turned that off.  Testers one and three were from a very similar background, which wasn&rsquo;t ideal from the point of view of getting a diverse range of input on the prototype.</p>

<p>I had quite a long chat with each individual about their background, goals, hopes and dreams; before ultimately segueing into introducing the prototype.  Although, by the end I was getting tired and not filling the full hour.  The patterns that emerged from these sessions was as follows:</p>

<h4>Negatives</h4>

<ul>
<li>Some terminology was confusing, e.g. MOOC</li>
<li>AV&rsquo;s purpose somewhat unclear. NGO? Learning/mentoring?</li>
<li>Prototype sections not obviously clickable</li>
<li>Too much text</li>
<li>Unclear who owns code - is this open source?</li>
<li>Unclear if meetings online or in person</li>
</ul>

<h4>Neutrals</h4>

<p>Testers wanted to know how to share with friends</p>

<h4>Positives</h4>

<ul>
<li>Concept and social aspect appreciated</li>
<li>Images and roadmap appreciated</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the really solid takeaways were how people seemed to really appreciate the visualization of the journey and the images and how the text needed to be both shortened and tightened up.  We were pretty shattered after over 30 hours in hangouts for this online design sprint, and ended up reviewing the next steps in our AV Community meeting the following Monday.  Some possible follow up actions included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Releasing a static site with the interactive infographic that points to our main site on the sign up link</li>
<li>Adjust the landing page of our site to better reflect the journey concept</li>
<li>Start creating a new main site perhaps in new tech</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the community meeting I asked everyone to suggest what they thought was the highest priority.  Michael&rsquo;s was that we get a static site up (even just the InVision site) and A/B test the impact on signups via Google AdWords.  The measurement component of this really appealed to me, and so this morning I snapped to it by setting up a GitHub Pages account and having that redirect to the InVision app.  I set up http://why.agileventures.org to point to that and the sign up button now goes to our main site.  The annoying things are the InVision URL showing as well as their loading screen.  In principle we could put image maps directly into our GitHub pages site &hellip; let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>I think either way the design sprint has weened me off large amounts of text and addicted me to small amounts of text with images.  Will be interesting to see if we can get any substantive change in signups - stay tuned to this blog to find out!</p>
