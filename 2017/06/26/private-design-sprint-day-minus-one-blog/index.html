        <h5 class='date'>26 Jun 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="design sprint" src="/images/design_sprint.png" /></p>

<p>So I find myself in a Premier Inn in Felixstowe on the west coast of the UK to run a design sprint for a private client. I&rsquo;ve just been adapting my morning schedule to the slight change in location.  Jog along the front listening to SoftSkillsAudio podcast.  Get distracted on LinkedIn trying to contact the show&rsquo;s hosts to get my skill recommendation for &ldquo;Artisanal Egg Scrambling&rdquo; for being their new unpaid marketing intern.  Getting caught up with Slack and Email (before blogging!) in the hotel restaurant. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got another 45 minutes before going off for this private in person sprint, which I won&rsquo;t be able to blog about more than tangentially since I have signed an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).  Hopefully I should be able to provide some general insights into the design sprint process face to face versus online, in comparison with the fully online sprint with AgileVentures the week before last.  The private project seems reasonably stimulating, but will be fully closed source for the forseeable future.  In some ways it&rsquo;s frustrating to be taken away from my focus on AgileVentures.  The NHS project took me away from AV too, but at least it was open source and something I could share with the Premium members; although to be honest there wasn&rsquo;t a huge rush of people to get involved, and/or it wasn&rsquo;t accessible because I was doing lots of face to face meetings that were not completely digitised.</p>

<p>Ironically this is also the week where I&rsquo;m working out the governance framework to allow the current AV income from the NHS project and subscriptions to actually cover my basic living expenses.  I&rsquo;m right up against the limit on my bank account and about to go overdrawn if I don&rsquo;t get that sorted by the end of the week.  If that is all sorted, things are basically covered, but I&rsquo;ll still need extra, like this private design sprint, in order to cover luxuries like taking my children to see their grandparents in Japan this summer and to pay for their music lessons, fix up the house, take my wife away for our anniversary etc. etc.</p>

<p>There are new pull-requests in on the WebSiteOne and LocalSupport projects; neither of them from Premium members.  I do wonder if we don&rsquo;t need a complete revamp of our AgileVentures Premium packages, and if we even need some sort of structured decision making process for AgileVentures, even if it&rsquo;s just a mechanism to allow people to hear about any changes we make.  Despite being distracted by Adobe Illustrator on the way up to Felixstowe, I did manage to pull out the set of Premium benefits and do a little translation into questions that might relate to our target demographic:</p>

<hr>

<p>There&rsquo;s a funny trade off between having nothing and when something is already existing.  Before Premium existed I could create anything in my mind and put it out there.  And I&rsquo;ve also been tweaking it since, but we end up with this state where different people have different impressions of what Premium is, based on when they most recently read about it, how they interpreted the words through their own personal filters, and what sorts of interactions they&rsquo;ve had over time.  </p>

<p>Then if you start making changes, it takes time for them to propagate into people&rsquo;s understanding.  Depending on how they hear about it, some people might be frustrated that things are changing out from underneath them.  In the regular AV team I think there&rsquo;s some agreement that how we present the Premium benefits should change.  It&rsquo;s easy to change the text, and I could just do it bang bang, but once something&rsquo;s out there frequent change can be disconcerting.  Perhaps the better approach is softly, softly - try and get a proportion of the existing Premium members to answer a survey with questions like the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which Premium benefit do you value the most?</li>
<li>Which Premium benefit is of least value to you?</li>
<li>What additional Premium benefits would you like to see?</li>
<li>How likely would you be to recommend AV Premium to a friend (scale 1-10)?</li>
<li>How happy are you with the Premium benefits package?</li>
</ol>

<p>and maybe others that the rest of the team can think of.  The survey would play a dual role in terms of soliciting input to better help us evolve the Premium packages, and also letting people know about impending changes.  I did do a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ll5lfMu1PCtgDRW63">survey of AV members last year</a> before we even had Premium - I should share that with the marketing team.  Perhaps we could send out a revised version as part of the newsletter?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely time to get another read there, and also a read from those who&rsquo;ve signed up for Premium as we evolve the next version.  Perhaps the private design sprint will help focus my mind on getting these things done &hellip;?</p>
