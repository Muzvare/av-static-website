        <h5 class='date'> 3 Feb 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="focusing" src="/images/focusing.jpg" /></p>

<p>I keep trying to focus on the right thing.  From a Buddhist perspective maybe the right thing to focus on is the here and now, the precious moment of current perception, at least where possible.  Still I&rsquo;m fascinated by this notion that one can use reason and data-analysis to work out how to achieve certain goals.  From a spiritual position, maybe being attached either way to the outcome of your goals is just going to lead to pain and disappointment?  I really don&rsquo;t know :-) </p>

<p>We had a new Premium member sign up yesterday.  I have a suspicion that our Google AdWords campaign might be helping.  The Google analytics interface showed me that the number of folks looking at a Premium payment page had increased by 1, and that this came from someone clicking through on our ad when they had been conducting a search with the word &ldquo;code&rdquo;, one that we&rsquo;d added last week after following suggestions from the AdWords interface:</p>

<p><img alt="hits on premium payment pages from &quot;code&quot; and &quot;coding&quot;" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jm3v72nx3jcj4v/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2009.57.27.png?dl=1" /></p>

<p>As we were welcoming the new Premium member into the AV Premium Slack it turned out that one of the Mentors knew them and, asking in a DM, I found out that that Mentor had recommended joining AgileVentures some time back.  I&rsquo;m in the process of <a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1545">adding the AdWords scripts</a> that should allow us to track purchase completions on the site, which should provide better information in the future, but it&rsquo;s interesting to think about the multi-dimensional nature of this process where an individual will, of course, be influenced by many things before making a purchase.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s very interesting is to look at the data about folks coming to our free signup page over the last seven days:</p>

<p><img alt="a week of sign up page activity" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/01zcjl43h6vfnk1/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.07.07.png?dl=1" /></p>

<p>Four days ago we rolled out Michael&rsquo;s enhanced call to action and the trend does seem to be up since then.  We also rolled out the additional keywords at the same time, so it&rsquo;s difficult to make a watertight case for one or the other being solely responsible.  However more click throughs to the sign up page implies an increase in the number of folks considering signing up, which seems like a good thing.   I wonder if it&rsquo;s worth setting up A/B tests?  Right now I&rsquo;m focused on the idea of an escalating call to action whereby we provide a button in the same prominent place as the current &ldquo;Sign up now to start coding!&rdquo; that says &ldquo;Upgrade to Premium for additional support&rdquo; for those who are already signed up:</p>

<p><img alt="current call to action when not signed in" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvxg55gju8re883/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.10.23.png?dl=1" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d spent the last few days dedicating most of my time to a project proposal for the drie folks, since that has the potential to bring in a lot of revenue, but they&rsquo;ve demurred on that, so my focus swings back to seeing if we can get the Premium income to a level that will be sustainable.  I really don&rsquo;t know.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll end up destroying the soul of the community with prominent calls to upgrade to Premium.  Maybe I&rsquo;m better off not trying to push the community towards generating enough revenue so that I can continue focusing on it full time?  Perhaps it should be just left alone, and I should go off and do contracting on other projects that won&rsquo;t synergise with AgileVentures.  </p>

<p>My furious task-switching comes from trying to focus on the thing that will bring in enough funds to support my family - perhaps I need to detach myself from that outcome in order to be truly happy?  There are loads of little issues with the site I&rsquo;d love to fix.  I have a suspicion that the site performance may be deteriorating under the increasing load, or is that just my imagination?  The production site hasn&rsquo;t been slow any time I&rsquo;ve tried to load it, and no one has complained to me directly.  What we can clearly see is nearly a five-fold increase in sessions on the site since the AdWords campaign kicked off:</p>

<p><img alt="activity over the last month" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jyiq5cq82zey5wq/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.17.27.png?dl=1" /></p>

<p>I can only see the last seven days on the NewRelic tracking of the site performance - seems like we&rsquo;d have to upgrade to see more.  I just applied to their nonprofit program to see if we can get that at a discount.  NewRelic is showing our Apdex score dropping below 0.7 a couple of times a day, which means that sometimes folks are trying to load the site and not getting a page.  I started off the EventManager project for a couple of Premium F2F folks (who&rsquo;ve since downgraded to Premium) as a place to experiment with Rails 5 websockets.  I started talking about a possible MicroServices architecture and now Matt is researching CDNs and ways to have the same assets served to different servers.</p>

<p>I feel like I have to be super-careful going for my focus on effectiveness.  I&rsquo;d love to be throwing all (the minimal) development resources we have into the place that will give us the most bang for the buck.  At the same time, pushing people away from their intuitions from what they think is important and towards the ones I think will gain traction can easily be counter-productive.  There are feelings to be hurt, egos to be bruised, and ultimately I don&rsquo;t know if my ideas are better than anyone else&rsquo;s.  Still I&rsquo;m enchanted by the idea of having an open mind to overturning assumptions about what is and isn&rsquo;t needed.  At the moment I&rsquo;m telling myself that if I can just get this escalating call to action feature out, I&rsquo;ll have done the basics, and can move into a more relaxed posture :-)</p>

<p>By the basics I mean that by rolling out the Premium plans and payment frameworks I&rsquo;ve demonstrated that it&rsquo;s possible to derive some income through this mechanism.  Now of course Bloc and others are already an existence proof that it&rsquo;s possible for others to derive income online from mentoring services, but I&rsquo;ve got it set up and working for us.  We&rsquo;ve got the charity red-tape sorted, the bank account set up, we&rsquo;re taking payments, covering our server costs and then some.  And all that without aggressively promoting Premium.  So, now, what&rsquo;s the way to sustainability?  Can the offering be improved?  Certainly.  Can the way it is described and featured on the individual Premium pages be improved?  Certainly.  Can the site and entire community be fixed up and supported better?  I&rsquo;m sure of it.  However I feel like we&rsquo;ve got to take that last step of actually letting people know directly on the site that this pathway is available.</p>

<p>Even having done so, there&rsquo;ll be loads of little smoothings and tweakings to make the flow along that pathway smoother.  I hope the presence of a smooth pathway won&rsquo;t ulimately be off-putting and counter-productive.  I&rsquo;d love to continue devoting my full-time efforts to AgileVentures for the years to come, but I can&rsquo;t do that unless the pathway is delivering the income to support myself and my loved ones.</p>

<p>I should end there, but of course the imagined pathway of signing up to the site, and then upgrading to Premium and Premium Mob etc. is not the only pathway.  There&rsquo;s the pathway for sponsors, paid projects and so forth.  I&rsquo;ll keep task-switching and chasing the dream that all this can sustain me full time.</p>
