        <h5 class='date'> 7 Feb 2017</h5>
    <p><img alt="mixed bag" src="/images/mixed_bag.jpg" /></p>

<p>I was pleased to be back blogging about code yesterday, but Monday didn&rsquo;t see any further focus on code.  I replied to all the incoming Slack queries, but not all the emails, and fitted in a fair few meetings.  It had been a few weeks since we had a LocalSupport client meeting and we managed to sneak one in between the &ldquo;Martin Fowler&rdquo; scrum and the marketing meeting.  We were able to get five or six stories, chores and bug fixes accepted, and confirm the pivot from organisation listing to volunteering; a thread that was picked up again in the Agile Book Club podcast later that day.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a slew of new action items there for me to follow up on, and reminds me I&rsquo;d love an automated bot to help me do project board review.  We&rsquo;ve lost any structure to LocalSupport and WebSiteOne sprints since we&rsquo;ve dropped explicit kick-off and retrospective meetings.  Maybe that means we&rsquo;re just failing at Agile, but I feel rock-bottom in terms of motivation for those kinds of meetings given the low level of enthusiasm for them in the past.  Both projects are seeing a resurgence of activity recently so maybe we should bring them back in at some point, but I&rsquo;m also enamoured with the idea of doing everything in a distributed asynchronous fashion using voting bots and project management bots.  </p>

<p>Overnight we managed a vote in WebSiteOne, and I started getting set up with Arreche&rsquo;s reworked slack integration bot that will hopefully provide a simpler interface and support multiple votes in parallel.   One step at a time, but I can&rsquo;t help speculating about a project bot that would automate, or semi-automate working through the project boards.  I think the boards need to be reviewed once a week and every &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; or &ldquo;current&rdquo; ticket needs to be checked on.  The heuristic I use is to check if there&rsquo;s been any activity in the last couple of days from the person taking the lead on the ticket.  If they&rsquo;ve pushed commits to a PR, added comments to the tickets then it can be left, but if there&rsquo;s been no activity of a while they need to be pinged to check on the status, see if the item can be re-assigned.</p>

<p>Full automation would be hard, but a semi-automated approach that presented each ticket in turn with its &ldquo;state of decay&rdquo; would be something to help reduce effort on the part of the project manager.  Even just a repeating alert to make sure the review was performed weekly would be helpful.  Maybe I should have had a quiet half hour to do that after the the client meeting, but I was straight into the marketing meeting as we reviewed our Google AdWords campaign performance, draft newsletter and content marketing strategy. </p>

<p>I had to leave marketing early to pair with Corey on a sticky point on WebSiteOne, where we&rsquo;d been going back and forth in a pull request to little apparent progress.  Once again the magic of the realtime hangout got us sorted.  I properly understood the problem that Corey was facing, which was writing an acceptance test for the the pop-up countdown timer.  Corey had been able to make it work by switching the Capybara driver from poltergeist to webkit, but that had the unfortunate side-effect of breaking a lot of other tests.  I was pretty sure we didn&rsquo;t need to switch the driver to get this to work, or at least pretty much anything else would be less effort than fixing all the other mercury editor related tests.</p>

<p>We used the debugger to see that the event countdown was present in the code being returned by the poltergeist driver:</p>
<pre class="highlight html"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"hidden-sm hidden-xs hidden-md"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"next-event"</span> <span class="na">data-event-time=</span><span class="s">"2014-02-03T07:00:00+00:00"</span> <span class="na">data-event-url=</span><span class="s">"/events/scrum"</span> <span class="na">data-event-name=</span><span class="s">"Scrum"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"/events/scrum"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Scrum<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> is live!<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Getting the clean output was the usual pain that made me think there must be a better way to get formatted HTML output on the irb/byebug prompt.  So much so that I just took a blog break to file an <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/327">issue on byebug</a> and research the matter.  Corey wondered if the screen width might be an issue and a quick google got us to the solution which was a step to increase the width of the virtual browser so that the popup would be shown:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">And</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/^the window size is wide$/</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="no">Capybara</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">page</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">current_window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">resize_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1300</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">400</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So I guess I lied, there was a tiny chunk of coding focus in the middle of the day. Then it was lunch and &ldquo;Kent Beck&rdquo; scrum and drie meeting catch up (they&rsquo;ve decided to build the dashboard themselves), and Agile Book Club podcast episode 2, which was great fun.  I bought the three pack of e-books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories</li>
<li>Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Tests</li>
<li>Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Retrospectives</li>
</ul>

<p>Great day really.  Now I just have to make sure that I follow up with the LocalSupport project elements, and get out some code to start tracking the sign ups that are coming in through the Google AdWords campaign.  I&rsquo;m trying to stay focused on the moment and not worry too much about how every little step adds up to any particular long term goal. Let&rsquo;s see what today brings :-)</p>
