&lt;p&gt;So confused about where to direct my efforts.  Maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter?  Maybe I should be avoiding code like Avdi Grimm?  I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by trying to clear up all the dependabot PRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just used my administrator privileges to merge in upgrades to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1898"&gt;Brakeman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1899"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1900"&gt;Bundler-Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1901"&gt;Jasmine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really clear what the first three gems do.  Jasmine allows us to unit test our JavaScript.  Trying to update all these four in succession, leading to merges getting stuck through the GitHub UI.  I&amp;rsquo;ve banged on them and I think they&amp;rsquo;re all through now.  I pull those changes locally to update my gems locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One project manager experienced a 500 error last night that I assume was performance related, but we get nothing from systems like AirBrake that are supposed to tell us about these things.  I sort of feel like for a system of this size, what we need is four full time engineers to keep maintaining it all.  Maybe upgrading to Rails 5 is the key?  Maybe spending no time with my family? Or maybe re-doing the whole thing in WordPress like Avdi and Chuck &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m putting my head down and getting every dependabot automated gem upgrade PR through now.  I generally shy away from making multiple changes like this, but I&amp;rsquo;m sick of the dependabot PRs drowning out the human PRs.  Of course even once I&amp;rsquo;ve got the green ones through, there are all those that have come through and caught on the CI.  Now some are clearly failing because code needs to change, but others will just be from intermittent jasmine fails.  I think if we could rip out Mercury and replace it with a new editor, and that might get rid of half the intermittent fails, and maybe clear the way to get onto Rails 5.  However, I am unclear precisely what Rails 5 really buys us - maybe the ability to use websockets cleanly and so avoid a lot of stale data for our users in their browsers.  That said, realistically we could fix some of the current staleness issues with timers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficultly with this dependabot system is that we&amp;rsquo;ve got hundreds of gems and there&amp;rsquo;s always going to be gem versions being bumped.  So even if I get through the current lot, there&amp;rsquo;ll be more to come.  Perhaps the trick is to get new members merging these PRs?  Although that would mean needing to give them merge privileges &amp;hellip; the ones where there&amp;rsquo;s work required are generally tricky and not necessarily a good place for new members.  Perhaps just having them take the green PRs and running them locally to double check the CI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I try to merge in more, I get conflicts in the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, which I try to patch up.  I go to all the other dependabot failing PRs and update their branches.  Am I just doing a very long slow drawn out &lt;code&gt;bundle update&lt;/code&gt; here?  Every single gem has to be tested with each other, in each combination.  The other issue is that every PR puts a load on our CI and our CI blocks deployment, so I&amp;rsquo;ve probably set us up to be unable to deploy anything today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a chunk of gems upgraded and I&amp;rsquo;m running the tests locally to check, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have so much faith in the tests. Hmmm.  What I do really want to do is get that new editor that Matt started working on and update the branch.  Matt&amp;rsquo;s been MIA for the longest of the different contributors.  I&amp;rsquo;m also seeing various messy messages in our build output.  When unclear about direction I guess maybe it&amp;rsquo;s best just to focus on cleaning things up &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly when I run RSpec in progress mode I can&amp;rsquo;t see which tests the deprecation warnings are coming from.  The main ones I&amp;rsquo;m getting are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEPRECATION WARNING: You attempted to assign a value which is not explicitly `true` or `false` ("never") to a boolean column. Currently this value casts to `false`. This will change to match Ruby's semantics, and will cast to `true` in Rails 5. If you would like to maintain the current behavior, you should explicitly handle the values you would like cast to `false`. (called from block (3 levels) in &amp;lt;top (required)&amp;gt; at /Users/tansaku/Documents/GitHub/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/spec/models/event_spec.rb:244)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unused parameters passed to Capybara::Queries::SelectorQuery : ["/auth/github"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WARNING: Using the `raise_error` matcher without providing a specific error or message risks false positives, since `raise_error` will match when Ruby raises a `NoMethodError`, `NameError` or `ArgumentError`, potentially allowing the expectation to pass without even executing the method you are intending to call. Actual error raised was #&amp;lt;ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::NotNullViolation: ERROR:  null value in column "user_id" violat...
: UPDATE "authentications" SET "user_id" = $1, "updated_at" = $2 WHERE "authentications"."id" = $3&amp;gt;. Instead consider providing a specific error class or message. This message can be suppressed by setting: `RSpec::Expectations.configuration.on_potential_false_positives = :nothing`. Called from /Users/tansaku/Documents/GitHub/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/spec/models/authentication_spec.rb:12:in `block (2 levels) in &amp;lt;top (required)&amp;gt;'.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, actually some of the error messages are telling me where the problems are arising &amp;hellip;  of course kicking off a cucumber test run locally blocks me from doing any coding work on the project for 10 minutes+ since we still have these stupidly long running tests in places &amp;hellip; I guess I will do my station keeping (social media updates) until they finish&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one failure in the cukes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Encountered Error in get: 404 Resource Not Found: {"code":"route_not_found","kind":"error","error":"The path you requested has no valid endpoint."}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having merged the conflict in the Medium-editor branch, I&amp;rsquo;m not even getting the chance to update the branch, so let&amp;rsquo;s at least try to clear up some cruft in the RSpec output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first item seems a little tricky, although it looks like we do need to fix it before we move to Rails 5, and it seems like I can fix it at the spec level as simply as adding this to the event model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;repeat_ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repeat_ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;repeat_ends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'on'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and fixing the factories to ensure they used &amp;lsquo;on&amp;rsquo; and &amp;#39;never&amp;rsquo; rather than booleans.  The issue here is that the underlying column type for &lt;code&gt;repeat_ends&lt;/code&gt; is boolean, but the model is working with it as a string.  Of course the real question is how the acceptance tests perform now.  I get a sequence of errors - if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky they are all about factories (being used in the Cukes).  They are not - they are actually using the full form, and we have javascript running in the browser to set things up - and it&amp;rsquo;s not showing certain fields.  There&amp;rsquo;s some complexity to fix all this, and even if I have the tests passing, I won&amp;rsquo;t be sure I haven&amp;rsquo;t introduced a bug into our events management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing the &lt;code&gt;raise_error&lt;/code&gt; issue is a trivial change to the spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'must have an associated user'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Bryan: validations done at database level to avoid complications, but will raise exceptions&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;raise_error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;StatementInvalid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &amp;lt;-- add this error type here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I decide to delete all the view specs, as those warnings are telling me that many of them aren&amp;rsquo;t testing what they should be.  In the ideal world I&amp;rsquo;d work through every single one and work out where they&amp;rsquo;re corresponding to in terms of missing acceptance test functionality, but part of the overall problem here is not having the resources to maintain so much code.  I think I need to hack and slash a bit to make some kind of progress.  Maybe I can spend tomorrow debugging the events &lt;code&gt;repeat_ends&lt;/code&gt; issue and I&amp;rsquo;ll have the RSpec output cleaned out.  Not sure that&amp;rsquo;s where my attention is most needed, but when I really can&amp;rsquo;t decide what high level issue to focus on, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing to do some sweeping up &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review What The Hell Was I Doing?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, my intention had been to work on the Azure Jitsi setup this week, but the last two mornings were taken up with finishing the AgileVentures monthly report for the trustees.  I did another quick bit of work on the main AgileVentures website to swap outgoing and incoming sponsor logos for Federico and deploy the new Premium member API for Michael.  Those are both now live, and I&amp;rsquo;m reflecting on whether to do more things that unblock others.  The first thing that springs to mind is the changes to the home page language that Lara has suggested based on analysis of the Google Adwords data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things going on include closing out all these dependabot gem upgrades; and whether we need to shut them off so we can see what we are doing.  Other hanging pull requests (oldest first) include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading to Rails 5 (blocked by mercury editor) - Matt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing mercury editor with alternate (medium clone) - Matt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automate streaming youtube from Jitsi - Lokesh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add text search form to members page - Ghost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bug fix for empty github repo - Praveen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refactoring slack service - Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add tawkto chat client - Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add calendar support - Sigu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add sponsor relation - Michael/Marian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flicked my eyes over other older and unvoted tickets in the waffle board.  So much stuff that could be worked on.  Who knows which are the key set that take us where we want to be, i.e. a clear comprehensible site that allows people to onboard and work productively together on open source charity projects.  Part of me wants to knock off the oldest hanging pull requests by taking over the work of those who&amp;rsquo;ve just dropped away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I did also start looking at alternate home page designs as part of thinking about how we can improve performance and do A/B testing on different landing pages in terms of how they bring folks on board.  And maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the most important part of our funnel?  Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s some of the keyword searches that have had our Google ad served, and the number of click throughs they&amp;rsquo;ve received:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality runs from 1 to 10 and our quality scores are low because these keywords are not appearing on our landing pages.  This means that we have to pay Google more of our ad budget for them.  Apparently our Google ad budget will go further if we can increase the instance of these terms on our home page.  In principle, a straightforward fix, and gets me thinking about getting set up for the A/B test of some alternate home pages, based on what we developed for our design sprint back in June.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I go ahead and create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1982"&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt;, actually using part of the form template that we have (should I adjust those?), and reflect on how I still don&amp;rsquo;t know if any of our Google AdWords activity has actually led to any revenue.  I know we&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of thousand additional users, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if any of them have helped make this whole enterprise more sustainable &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, given I have a ticket, that gives me license to create a branch on which to do the work.  Let&amp;rsquo;s review the chunks of text we have on the home page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Launch Pad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgileVentures is the perfect place to kick-start a project. Our system of openness and lack of hierarchy means anybody can start a project. In fact, many of our current projects were initiated by our own members!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdsourced Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By crowd-sourcing our projects, we attract developers from diverse backgrounds: students, freelancers, designers, teachers, and many more from all corners of the globe. Our members are driven by their passion to learn code and make a contribution to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have regular daily meetings (scrums) online where our members get together, discuss projects, share knowledge and plan programming sessions. We love pair programming, nobody works alone in this community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love all things Open Source, we are fully transparent in our development process, we record videos of all our meetings through Google+ Hangouts, our code is freely available on the web on GitHub and our project plans are publicly viewable on Pivotal Tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are things I&amp;rsquo;d love to change here, but the funny thing is that we do already mention several of the different keywords I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be adding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open source: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agile methodology: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coding: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrum: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;website coding: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder if what we need are custom landing pages for our different Google AdWords campaigns, so that folks searching for particular content can land on a page that speaks their language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a stab at adding more of the keywords into our langauge.  Just tweaks really, but also to mention the focus on charity and non-profit.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get this up and see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Launch Pad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to start a new charity or non-profit coding project? Our community of open source practitioners can help you get started coding and using agile methodology to deliver value quickly to your end users.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdsourced Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By crowd-sourcing our projects, we attract developers from diverse backgrounds: students, freelancers, designers, teachers, and many more from all corners of the globe. Our members are driven by their passion to learn to code and make a contribution to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have regular daily meetings (scrums) online where our members get together, discuss projects, share knowledge and plan programming sessions. We love pair programming, mob programming and shared code review to help everyone learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love all things Open Source and are fully transparent in our development process. We record videos of all our meetings through Google Hangouts; all our code can be viewed on GitHub and our project plans are publicly viewable on systems like Pivotal Tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get that up in a pull request.  Gosh, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s the key place to push on.  Doing things that people ask for is a reasonable first order heuristic, I guess.  Another is clearing up hanging PRs.  The clear pattern that I see is that when I reach out to people individually, that is what seems to have the highest success rate in terms of bringing in new contracts and subscriptions &amp;hellip; hmmm &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Completing Reports</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="report" src="/images/report.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports almost completed, just trying to summarise where we are with all the different Premium members.  Trying also to reach out to check in with each of them.  I was doing that weekly but have fallen behind.  I&amp;rsquo;ve configured Stripe to ping a #mentor-notifications channel whenever we get a payment.  I try to thank each member individually.  Paypal sends me an email, and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any reminder system for those who&amp;rsquo;ve been block sponsored by bootcamps so I particularly fall behind on those checkins :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through the Stripe notifications in #mentors-notifications involves me being in Slack and so I get distracted by Slack, although this morning I am getting distracted by answering questions to Premium members, and even looking at requests for upgrades, so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the executive summary of the finally finished report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not such a great month, in that we lost our main corporate sponsor.  We did gain a new one, but they are offering services in kind rather than cash.  The couple of Premium member cancellations were balanced by sponsored members taking over payment of their memberships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam started new mobs and ran many free trial F2F sessions which are looking like they might make for a nice set of upgrades and new members next month.  We shall have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rolled out video embeds for the NHS project and are still negotiating with the literary society over their web and database project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep meaning to move all the data on Premiums into some coherent form and also to reach out to members consistenly to let them know about our new offerings.  This month I&amp;rsquo;ve just been in a scramble to make sure I reach out to everyone.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and keep the report template for the next month open and make updates to it as they come in.  I&amp;rsquo;m reticent to start recording all our data about Premium members in AgileCRM.  It says we&amp;rsquo;d need to pay for automation.  I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to start putting notes into a spreadsheet - or should all the data be being stored in WebSiteOne?  We&amp;rsquo;re starting to improve the model there, with work from Michael and Marian; and me updating the data itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the key use case for AgileCRM, or any system for showing status on Premiums, is to allow mentors such as Lara and Federico to be able to get a bit more background on the different people they&amp;rsquo;re talking to.  There are privacy concerns with all this personal data.  Maybe we need some Mentors Convenant that would be agreed to before we give new mentors access to all the data on the mentees &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Behind on Reports</title>

&lt;p&gt;Totally distracted by Slack and Email, but more importantly behind on reports.  I was just a couple of days late on the NHS HLP monthly report, but I&amp;rsquo;m now a good weekend behind on the AgileVentures monthly report.  These monthly reports are part of the deal with the AgileVentures trustees for my consulting company providing the core AgileVentures support contract.   I have been working through creating the latest one, but the explosion of new mobs and pairing sessions, and procrastination on my part means there&amp;rsquo;s still a chunk to do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also massively behind on my usual checkins with Premium members.  We&amp;rsquo;re trying to move the report around so that it&amp;rsquo;s less detailed stats that take me too long to put together and focuses on the progress of the individual premium members.  I&amp;rsquo;d really like a clear day to review where we are with each individual Premium member.  Having created the initial report structure with lots of details, I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of fallen into a trap of trying to replicate those details every month.  Should I then burn time trying to automate parts of the report?   Drop some of those stats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just spent ten minutes getting the stats together for the last month of mobs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;| Date      | Mob Topic | #Attendees | Names                                                 |

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to check with everyone before sharing their first names above? I guess I can run it through an anonymizer if anyone is bothered.  I&amp;rsquo;m keen to share these stats, and I&amp;rsquo;m really keen on transparency, but not everyone wants every part of what they do transparent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve spent another 10 minutes getting all the data on F2F pairing sessions:&lt;/p&gt;

| 11/17 Fri | Phoenix       | Ryder          |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so with the work from last week on meetings stats and web stats, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the main stats part of the report, but not the update of individual Premium members, or reaching out to all the Premiums to check how they are doing.  With my schedule today that&amp;rsquo;ll have to be tomorrow &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="packing too much in " src="/images/packing_too_much_in.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I squeezed in a LocalSupport client meeting this morning and I have an F2F pairing session coming up, so there&amp;rsquo;s not much time for review.  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I should focus next week on Jitsi on Azure, although I&amp;rsquo;d love to revisit our slack bots, pings, and even consider a react-ification of our getting started pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I think the most important thing for me to do right now is work through the follow up from the LocalSupport client meeting.  LocalSupport is our longest running project and is a key part of the AgileVentures ecosystem.  I had what felt like  a productive meeting, in that I had managed to implement some cost savings for LocalSupport by switching to free https certificates.  I still wonder if I should have been further questioning whether VAHC really wanted to push forward with this project, but hey, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing now is that the client asked to have put on a &amp;ldquo;back burner&amp;rdquo; certain tickets that had been started by some developers.  These relate to members of the public being able to submit new events.  We also rejected a ticket on the breadcrumbs functionality in the system.  Now I have the choice to be alerting developers through the Pivotal Tracker system or through Slack.  I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the tracker, and then maybe follow up in Slack.  It&amp;rsquo;s potentially a sensitive thing as it will probably mean shifting people around on what they&amp;rsquo;re working on and some careful explanations of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just jumping to GitHub to review the pull requests I see GitHub now has new vulnerability checks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/81z7w7hkh3tacb3/Screenshot%202017-11-17%2010.49.35.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is flagging a low risk vulnerability in RuboCop - we can easily upgrade that, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get distracted &amp;hellip; so much to pack in, so little time &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review One Thing After Another</title>

&lt;p&gt;Some days it&amp;rsquo;s just one thing after another.  As Wednesday was drawing to a close I was feeling pretty pleased to have fixes out for our Slack invites (confirmed as all the recent sign ups had already been invited this morning), and for one-off events not showing up.  I knew we also had some kind of javascript error affecting the calendar popups on the create event page, but it turns out that some kind of failure in our Google Analytics code is systematically breaking JavaScript througout the site.  I managed to fix that last night by turning off the analytics, but that&amp;rsquo;s a short term fix as we need that working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just fire-fighting crazily here?  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about the requests that Federico put in for RSVPs, alerts when members join projects, Fred asking for the jitsi server &amp;hellip;  Anyway this is systemic and we need to report analytics to the trustees.  I was able to replicate the failure on staging - perhaps I can replicate it locally.  I can trigger the error locally by running the server like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ENABLE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=true be rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jasmine tests work fine, even with analytics enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;→ ENABLE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=true bej

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'create'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'UA-47795185-1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'auto'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'send'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'pageview'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what we have here is a mix of old and new GA tracking code, and the problem that none of it actually gets run until we go into production, where google analytics is switched on.  Looking up both old and new code, I can&amp;rsquo;t immediately see a way to reconcile them, so I&amp;rsquo;ve commented out the offending code, and so will get that up until we can work out an effective combined approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think rather than switching GA code on and off globally we should have different account ids for different instances, and set that via ENV vars &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
