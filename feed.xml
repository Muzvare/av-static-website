    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pair flying" src="/images/pairflying.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I graduated a distance-learning masters in applied mathematics. Every month, the university mailed me an A4 enveloppe containing the course support. I was supposed to learn from the course material and returned the completed assignments within a month. A month later, I would receive an answer key.Â Should I have a question, I could mail it to the professor and wait for his reply. The whole process was cumbersome. I was often behind schedule. Interactivity was near to zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I participated in the MOOC endeavour. The video of the instructor gave a feeling of a one-to-one training session. Discussion forums, deadlines, follow-up mails, peer-reviews grounded the learning process. There were meetups too. And a MOOC about Agile Development using Ruby On Rails offered remote pair-programming sessions between participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair-programmming reuses the rather old organizational pattern of pilot+copilot : double-check, higher focusing, external view, and stronger engagement. You may object that programming is very different from flying. Yes, it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming requires a strong level of accuracy too. Your pairing fellow is both a watch dog that tells you not to call a library without checking how it works, not to cut and paste code across your work, and an inspiration to experiment with new ways of coding. As some aerobatic aircrafts don&amp;rsquo;t include a copilot seat, some programs are implemented by lone wolves in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like teamviewer, logmein, skype, hangout or joinme have been instrumental to the success of remote pair working. There is still room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a face-to-face meeting, there is a desk between the two interlocutors. Webcams should recreate this confortable spacing. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a barber nor a dental professional!
2) Remote working platforms lack of interoperability. Some only run on Windows, some require to install a software, others are more suitable for mobile use&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t try to connect to hangout with skype
3) Security is a weak point for all of these platforms. Choosing which window you share, which you don&amp;rsquo;t, masking your passwords or your personal information are not intuitive. In my earlier days, I remembered displaying my passwords on a recorded session. Not so good a security practice!
4) Optimizing the screen definition so that everybody can watch comfortably is not supported either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desktop application from IDE to word processors will probably include some kind of remote pair working feature sooner or later. C9 already includes some simple pair-programming features, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs in the code? Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me, it&amp;rsquo;s my pair programming partner who fooled around!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another free refill?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free refill" src="/images/freerefill.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I undertook a training session targeting small business manager to teach them how to improve profitability of business projects. The course instructor showed us a rather clear way to deal with profitabiliy. First, you estimate your break-even hourly rate, based on your history. Then, you don&amp;rsquo;t sell any project under the bottom line. After that, you prioritize your work to put the highest priority on the most profitable projects. Finally, you keep any accepted project above the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to the execution. I began to schedule my workday according to business priorities preferably to a sense of urgency that overcame me before. Then, everytime I felt I was at risk to hit the bottom line, I shifted my attention towards what I really sold to the client annd I reduced my objectives accordingly. Finally, I was trying to become a project reviewer for a well known MOOC platform. But the hourly rate was much too low. I felt relief to drop my candidature. Paid projects management improved greatly. But, a significant part of my workday, dedicated to volunteer projects, was out of the scope of this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many commitments, workaholism, things we begin and we never achieve, any freelance worker faces these contradictions. The inherent contradiction is even stronger when you work on non-paid project. How to prioritize your volunteer works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten working hours a day is my upper limit, considering that I&amp;rsquo;m not a computer nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a family, hobbies, and a social life &amp;hellip; I was already busy ten hours a day. Adding anything to my schedule implied removing something else. I have been more or less active on professional social networks for three years. I first thought this commitment would improve my reputation and fuel my prospect pipeline. But in three years, the return was not very encouraging. I felt that my social network activity was fueled by bitterness or anxiety or ego or the three rather than by a clear sense of business opportunity! I decided to forget social networks. Two to three hours a week were freed thanks to this good resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to devote these hours to Agile Venture mob programming sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s a real community, with real developers. You can both learn by observing how skilled developers work and by doing things by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the midstream of my prioritization effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very actively participating in MOOCs for five years. My skills greatly improved as a result of this effort.  But choosing which courses to invest on is not easy. Knowledge is a bit like indirects costs. You don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to assign it to your achievements. During the first years, the offer flourished. I tried many courses, from Economy to Computer Sciences. I progressively focused on Computer Science and left courses as they switched to paid offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was giving up, a prominent MOOC platform offers me to beta-test courses for free. Free refill is the end of resolution and the beginning of passive hyperactivity! You may begin your training week with a course on Embedded systems and end, on friday, with a course on PythonML on friday, without completing any. Does it make sense to participate in a mob programming session about RSPEC on monday, another one about phoenix on wednesday, on the last one about React on friday, when you only need to develop a small web app with React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileVenture Premium Mob includes some kind of Professional Development Planning Support. I may ask the team to help me clean my training plan. But I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid they will tell me to stop learning Tensor Flow or the nitty gritty of Intel Parallel Architecture if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any prospect to work in these fields in the next year! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Return</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from my travels and it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back to work, jet-lagged or not.  I was working on my travels but eschewed blogging and hangouts, as is my usual practice.  My plan now back is to keep focusing on the AgileVentures &amp;ldquo;ecosystem&amp;rdquo;, by which I mean the website, Slack, our Social Media and all parts of how AgileVentures interacts with members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did manage to do while away was improve the performance on the events page, so it now loads in under two seconds rather than in more than five.  I think that&amp;rsquo;s an important step forward.  I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with the changes wrought from my reviews in July, reinstating the password based signup (using Google&amp;rsquo;s ReCaptcha to fight spam bots), a &amp;ldquo;getting started&amp;rdquo; page that is shorter and emphasizes our key projects, and a more pointed Premium members page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it feels like there is so much more to do on the getting started page before it really operates as a really scaffolded guide for those getting started in AgileVentures.  My hypothesis is that the majority of people take a look and see too much text, and don&amp;rsquo;t really have enough of a guide to help them really get started.  My hunch is something that could remember the user and scaffold them on their way towards submitting their first pull-request on a project could make a big difference.  A quick glance over the Premium membership page leaves me feeling it also has too much text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it&amp;rsquo;s easy to come up with hypotheses, move heaven and earth to change things around, only to discover there&amp;rsquo;s not actually much impact.  The other thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been committing myself to is to measuring changes and testing alternatives.  My memory is that I made a few changes in July that I should be able to get some data on now.  However I haven&amp;rsquo;t even managed to push those &amp;ldquo;blogs&amp;rdquo; out, so I need to dig back through my pull requests to find out what I was doing &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I notice that all my dropbox images are not showing up &amp;hellip; it looks like Dropbox has adjusted their file download so that images are served so that they won&amp;rsquo;t display in the browser.  Unfortunately this will mean that all my blogs on our nonprofit static site will be without embedded images &amp;hellip; or so I would have thought, but actually they show up there, meaning this may well be github markdown specific. Gah, talk about yak-shaving.   To see my previous blogs with images I need to move all the image files around in git.  Well, until if/when GitHub fixes then it will affect folks ability to review my drafts to let&amp;rsquo;s get it fixed &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that took about five minutes and now I can see my first website review blog with images here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/av-static-website/blob/av&lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt;review&lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt;one&lt;em&gt;blog/source/blog&lt;/em&gt;articles/2017-07-05-av-website-review-part-one.html.markdown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I should be checking up on is what effect we had from the changes I made to the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page.  The drop-off from that page for the period Jul 3rd - Jul 31st 2017 is (222 vs 595) 37.3% of total traffic; compared to Jun 4th -Jul 2nd 2017 is (344 vs 500) 40.8% of total traffic, which is an improvement, but not conclusive.  That change could be due to seasonal or random fluctuations. If I compare with the same period last year (72 vs 156) 31.6% we se a lower dropoff rate, for a much smaller overall number of site visitors &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly I can&amp;rsquo;t easily do comparisons in on the behaviour flow page in Google Analytics.  Conversely in the chrome plugin I can see these side by side, although I seem to be seeing PageView rather than session data. (Sessions = Unique PageViews?) The plugin shows that overall traffic to the page was down, but the bounce rate dropped by over 28% which is a big change &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to go through all this again tomorrow when I&amp;rsquo;m not jet-lagged &amp;hellip; apparently bounce rate is not the same as drop off:&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a blogging/reviewing break for my Japan trip - perhaps I can get up to date pushing out some old blogs.  Over the last couple of weeks of these &amp;ldquo;reviews&amp;rdquo; of the AV website (and associated ecosystem) I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get some changes out to the main site.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s early to be assessing the changes - that should probably be the first thing to do in September when I plan to restart this series under the more accurate title &amp;ldquo;ecosystem review&amp;rdquo;.  The main changes I&amp;rsquo;ve enacted so far are getting a privacy statement linked up and reinstating email sign ups with a Google reCaptcha system to block the spambots signing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also simplified the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; page and rewrote parts of the Premium page.  I can see there&amp;rsquo;s lots more work to do there.  The Premium plan overview page is still very text heavy, as are the individual Premium pages.  The events page is loading really slowly at the moment.  Six seconds is not good. New Relic shows that the slowness is a split between the index method in the controller and the index.html.erb template itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/pue0dkn4373lcbb/Screenshot%202017-07-20%2009.37.31.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m conflicted about whether to investigate that further, or try to deploy the new greeting bot with the new functionality and updates for the other project maintainers &amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;ve gone for deploying the new project greeting bot.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a maintainer testing it live in his main project channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ov99d3ogm4jq9lw/Screenshot%202017-07-20%2009.59.55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the thing I need, to profile the events controller, is to clone the production data locally again, which I also did after opening some more project greeter bot tickets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot/issues/15"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/project_greeter_bot/issues/15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t immediately see a solution to the slow event page loading, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found our old open issue and added notes there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1503"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1503&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got other fish to fry today, e.g. getting the NHS HLP wiki ssl certs renewed.  Gosh I&amp;rsquo;d love to be paid at market rates for keeping the AgileVentures ecosystem running &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve got some suggested channel greeter bot text from at least one project maintainer.  I&amp;rsquo;m also running behind today, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get the websiteone sign up changes deployed &amp;hellip; I checked that the recaptcha sign up works on staging, which it does and filed a bug report about the double sign up message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1743"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1743&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stabbed around with the hangout and youtube notifications and am still not getting consistency, but the video play is still working in all the right places.  I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing the Jitsi buttons on develop, which makes it seem like we had a deploy fail, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see that in the semaphore history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ssmcw84gzal6u43/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.02.41.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ah, but they&amp;rsquo;re visible on the events, not projects.  Okay, that looks good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/90dboy3bg5qmm82/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.01.29.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well we might want to resize and/or provide some sort of flow here so that it&amp;rsquo;s clear what people should do.  What we could have is detection of the button press, and then we could ping Slack that someone&amp;rsquo;s joining the hangout.  Okay, I think the plan should be to get the recaptcha stuff out onto production and tomorrow maybe I can review the site flow experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also tempted (though I&amp;rsquo;m over time) to try and get the project greeter bot able to mention the new user name &amp;hellip; and I did - though not deployed - sent preview to project maintainer for approval:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/41xijwjt9186nx0/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.28.18.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just worrying if it&amp;rsquo;s a bit long &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I think I should step away from the project greeting bots and just check the new sign up flow as it gets deployed.  First thing is that I need reCaptcha keys on the heroku servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/9wti29f0ihs7s7e/Screenshot%202017-07-18%2009.39.37.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing that gives us the new reCaptcha sign up page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/hncj4kvhndkebst/Screenshot%202017-07-18%2009.44.07.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I manually test and it seems to work on develop and the rest of the site seems okay.  I notice that the new Jitsi button hasn&amp;rsquo;t been deployed, which likely means we have another intermittent failure on the CI and indeed we do.  For reference here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Given that there are 25 past scrums # features/step_definitions/scrums_steps.rb:28
      PG::UniqueViolation: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "index_users_on_slug"
      DETAIL:  Key (slug)=(zella-lubowitz) already exists.
      : INSERT INTO "users" ("first_name", "last_name", "email", "encrypted_password", "slug", "bio", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8) RETURNING "id" (ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique)
      ./features/step_definitions/scrums_steps.rb:29:in `/^that there are (\d+) past scrums$/'
      features/scrums.feature:8:in `Given that there are 25 past scrums'


      Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/scrums.feature:10 # Scenario: Scrums index page renders a timeline of scrums for users to view in descending order
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting a bit ridiculous recently and it feels like we are back to having a couple of intermittent fails before any CI build will complete.  They are usually JavaScript issues, but the one above is odd because it appears database related, but I guess it could still be some sort of JavaScript race condition.  Michael and I spent a lot of time sandboxing and re-implementing the cukes to reduce variability, but while things got better for a while, the problem is still there.  A short term fix is adding more of the regular culprits to the don&amp;rsquo;t run on CI list.   I wish there was a more consistent approach.  Maybe the Rails 5 upgrade might help, if we upgrade Capybara etc. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot do further testing on the flow through the system (or the new Jitsi buttons) until the CI passes again and deploys to either staging or develop.  It&amp;rsquo;s super frustrating when I want to stay focused at resolving usability issues in the interface that I&amp;rsquo;m getting distracted by the deploy logistics.  I wonder if the better solution is to avoid JavaScript dependent acceptance tests &amp;hellip; The difficulty with intermittent failures on CI is the feedback loop is so slow.  I guess we could start paying Semaphore for faster builds, but I think we&amp;rsquo;d need to bring in more funds to be able to afford that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well in the meantime I can ask all the project maintainers what message they&amp;rsquo;d like in their greeter bots &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
