&lt;p&gt;Well I totally failed to avoid Slack and Email before blogging this AM.  Again it was posting the update about the podcast that I&amp;rsquo;d listened to.  I&amp;rsquo;d had this idea to post to Twitter and then leave posting it to Slack till after the blog, but going into #techtalk on Slack I see a post by another community member, reply to that, post my podcast update and then I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the self-control not to look through the other channels.  And once I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, hell, I might as well look at my email :-) Perhaps, fortunately there was not too much going on, so I&amp;rsquo;m back at the blog pretty quickly.  I have found a Slack command line interface (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rlister/slackcat"&gt;SlackCat&lt;/a&gt;) that allows me to post an update without looking at the rest of the Slack.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll use that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course just firing off to #techtalk without going in there to check if there&amp;rsquo;s an ongoing conversation might be a little inconsiderate.  Could I have some mechanism that would hold the update ready to go until the previous update didn&amp;rsquo;t have a question mark on the end?  Gosh, what a convoluted train of thought! :-) The structure I&amp;rsquo;m building to try and deal with a lack of willpower &amp;hellip; Maybe I need the willpower workout, or maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I don&amp;rsquo;t get straight to the blog &amp;hellip; just why are Slack and Email so addictive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was going to try and link this all tangentially to the subject of Sprints, an important part of the Agile Scrum process whereby work is timeboxed into multi-week sprints.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty lax on formal Sprints in the projects I&amp;rsquo;m managing recently.  We used to do them regularly on LocalSupport and WebSiteOne with a weekly meeting that tried to combine retrospective and planning elements.  As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, it seemed like there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much enthusiasm for the meetings, and it was quite de-motivating to go to the effort of arranging them when not many people would show up.  Or even more so if they would say they would turn up and then cancel at the last minute, or not even send word that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reading more about Sprint philosophy for the book I&amp;rsquo;m writing on &amp;ldquo;Agile Methods in Open Source Projects&amp;rdquo; and Pat Bolger&amp;rsquo;s effective use of Sprints in the MetPlus and WikiEduDashboard projects, AND Michael&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm for a new kind of structure to planning meetings in WebSiteOne, has got me all gung-ho for Sprints now.  It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how different areas of Agile, Scrum and XP overlap.  Pair programming is great for keeping focused on a task.  As I&amp;rsquo;ve dialled back the amount of pairing I do, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending less time coding.  There are lots of admin things to do, and that&amp;rsquo;s partly why I&amp;rsquo;ve gone for more solo sessions, since they can be organised more easily at the last minute.  However in absence of pairing and a sprint structure, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for things to just drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a committment as part of a Sprint that a certain amount of work will get done during that Sprint is no guarantee that the work will get done.  However we&amp;rsquo;re now in our second week-long Sprint in the new WebSiteOne flow and I&amp;rsquo;m finding that committing to complete a certain number of tickets in a &amp;ldquo;formal&amp;rdquo; meeting is proving reasonably effective at keeping me on task in the absence of pairing.  It&amp;rsquo;s inspired me to start more formal Sprints for the LocalSupport, AsyncVoter and Redeemify projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a AsyncVoter kick off yesterday involving Arreche and myself in which we found ourselves a little early to vote on new features, but we both made commitments to sorting out certain infrastructure issues.  It&amp;rsquo;s too early to say whether this will all have a big long-term impact, but particuarly since the afternoon (UTC) Kent Beck scrums have been relatively slow recently, I&amp;rsquo;m going for making each one a &amp;ldquo;Sprint kick-off&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday (LocalSupport)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday (AsyncVoter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday (Redeemify)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday (WebSiteOne)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think maybe Redeemify should be on Tuesday.  Perhaps the daily scrums should be renamed after their project focus, instead of &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo;.  What I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do is give the impression that other project business couldn&amp;rsquo;t be discussed there &amp;hellip; maybe the thing to do is set up a repeating event that takes place after the &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo; scrum of scrums?  Rather than just letting the scrum event bleed over as I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should be going to take Agile and Scrum certification, but I&amp;rsquo;m not inspired by what feels to me like a rubber stamping process.  I feel like true learning comes from doing things in the trenches.  Trying out one technique, tweaking it, reflecting and so forth.  Not that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t learn something from seeing the inside of the &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; Agile/Scrum certification, but at arond Â£1000 a pop, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to sort my financial situation first.  Then again do you need to speculate to accumulate?  Should we perhaps be using the limited AV funds to pay for Agile certification for people like myself, Pat and Lara, so that we could advertise that projects brought to AV would have a dedicated certified scrum master?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.  There is infinite flexibility.  I hate having to nail things down and saying we&amp;rsquo;ll do this or that.  I&amp;rsquo;d much rather let things evolve and see what happens; hear what people want then offer it, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting for people to explain what they want.  You need to work out what they want through some other mechanism and then communicate to them that you have just what they need, so they can find it there all laid out for them &amp;hellip; maybe &amp;hellip; :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my taking one thing off my desk a day is at least keeping my desk in a steady state rather than becoming completely overwhelemed with pieces of paper.  I still haven&amp;rsquo;t thrown out my old filing cabinet, and I got caught by Slack/Email before getting down to this blog &amp;hellip; urgh.  One day at a time on the ever present moment path to enlightement :-)  Anyhow, my generally despondent feelings about applying for grants were not buoyed by us failing to get the Nelson Mandela Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Website and Intranet project.  I think I spent about 4 or 5 hours on that last week.  A good learning experience for Pat, Lara and myself, and certainly worth going for, as landing it would have made a huge difference to our community.  Good preparation for subsequent bids, but a bit deflating coming hot on the heels of another bid failure from the previous Thursday.  I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a couple of other micro-bids on my plate, but I fear they might be distractions from the one larger project that by itself will probably sort my financial worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to have a proposal for that larger project done by this coming Monday.  No one&amp;rsquo;s jumping out of Slack or Hangouts to make me work on it, so the danger is that I get distracted and fail to generate a good proposal.  I took some steps towards avoiding that last night by sorting a basic set of estimates, and also working with InVision.  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about a &lt;a href="https://thoughtbot.com/product-design-sprint/guide"&gt;ThoughtBot style Design Sprint&lt;/a&gt; for the client, and I notice that Thoughtbot is now recommending the &lt;a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/"&gt;InVision system&lt;/a&gt; over paper prototyping for quickly preparing UI mockups to get fast feedback from stakeholders.  I spent a little time getting a version of the AV site up in InVision and got comfortable with the system.  The key thing is creating hot spots on images to allow users to click through from one screen mockup to another.  The experience can then be shared with a &lt;a href="https://invis.io/B7ARISKJV#/222386846_Home_Screen"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily a quantum leap over doing the same sort of thing with PowerPoint or KeyNote, but the ability to drag and drop hotspots makes the InVision something that one can more quickly mock things up in.  Here you can see a few hotspots in green and the fixed nav bar that I made after just taking a few screenshots of the AV site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mockup of AV site" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3b3l3q0z5poqfo/Screenshot%202017-03-08%2010.18.00.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughtbot&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus-middleman"&gt;Proteus Middleman&lt;/a&gt; also looks like fun for things that need more complex interactions.  Having satisfied myself that I&amp;rsquo;ve got some good tools to work with for a Design Sprint, I think I pretty much have my proposal for next week.  Not sure if I need to write out a load more text - what I really want to do is pull a load more information out about the stakeholders and participants and so on.  What I will be needing to do is make a decision about CSS and JavaScript frameworks, and probably in the short term that will be Bootstrap and React, since those are the ones that I&amp;rsquo;m most comfortable with at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m left with is the focus today, which I&amp;rsquo;d love to spend just kicking around more prototypes and exploring, or second best, just responding to the PRs and comments in my GitHub notifications, relating to the various AgileVentures projects.  However there&amp;rsquo;s another small bid that I could be focused on.  Apparently today is the last day I can phone to ask questions about it, and it needs to be submitted for Friday.  It&amp;rsquo;s small change, and feels a bit like a setup for more effort to be followed by a rejection, but even a single paid project now could serve as a great incentive to sign up more AgileVentures Premium members with the benefit of being eligible for such paid projects; which may be one of those things that can keep the community growing.  Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked myself into it - I&amp;rsquo;ll just make a coffee and get started.  Well, &amp;hellip;, after I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at one or two pull requests :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed out some changes to the main AgileVentures landing page last night.  I&amp;rsquo;d had a set ready from last week&amp;rsquo;s sprint on Friday, but rather than push them straight out I&amp;rsquo;d held them on staging and posted an image of them to the #websiteone channel on Slack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="reworked home page" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1em05z5kzqdk0ln/Screenshot%202017-03-06%2013.13.56.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I did, as I got lots of great feedback.  I&amp;rsquo;d got a round of feedback in the &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo; scrum on Friday, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling entirely comfortable with the result, and the reaction from several in the #websiteone channel was that it didn&amp;rsquo;t look great and was a bit too wordy, so I held off to review things in Monday&amp;rsquo;s marketing meeting.  Lara asked, why move the button when it was already &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo;. Marufa concurred there was too much text, and I was thinking maybe reduce the font size and add more whitespace padding/margin around it to make it all less busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Lara also recommended an analytics plugin for Chrome which made me think rather differently.  The &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-analytics-by-google/fnbdnhhicmebfgdgglcdacdapkcihcoh?hl=en"&gt;Page Analytics&lt;/a&gt; plugin by Google annotates a site with information about where users are clicking based on Google Analytics tracking.  It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="page analytics plugin on AV.org" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5huv3vgkftr50wc/Screenshot%202017-03-07%2009.52.42.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a fantastic example of how data visualization can make all the difference.  All the other different displays of data and flow through the site in Google Analytics had so far failed to help me feel I was understanding what was going on as people browsed the site.  The main thing that really popped out of this visualization is that 13% of those arriving at the page did click through on the round &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; banner, followed by ~5% on the &amp;ldquo;learn&amp;rdquo; banner.  We&amp;rsquo;d had feedback from at least one user that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t realised the round banners were clickable, but clearly a non-trivial portion of recent visitors (the graphic above is from the last month&amp;rsquo;s traffic) are clicking through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that might reflect the preponderence of those keywords being used in our AdWords campaigns.  Lara was saying the &amp;ldquo;Get started now to begin coding&amp;rdquo; button was working because we had 23% click through.  Although the way this plugin works, it can&amp;rsquo;t distinguish where a user is clicking; rather it seems it just checks which URL they land on next, as I see the &amp;ldquo;Sign up&amp;rdquo; link in the top right corner is also marked up with a 23%.  Now I assume that people are probably clicking through on the large visible button, but seeing that we clearly did have some non-trivial level of click through on the round banners, and that we had some questions about the proposed text only change, made me roll back the text change and just push out two other minor changes for guest users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Change main call to action button text from &amp;ldquo;Sign up now to start coding&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Get started now to begin coding&amp;rdquo;
2) Change scrum link from title of scrum to &amp;ldquo;Want to learn more? Listen in. Next projects review meeting in x hours&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are less controversial and I hypothesize that the second might conceivably bring some more folks into hangouts, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to tell intuitively over the course of the week if there are any new faces showing up.  Maybe we should be A/B testing the change to the button text, but I can justify that quick fix in terms of making the text consistent with other changes we&amp;rsquo;ve been making on the other pricing and Premium pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m left conflicted about the next steps.  It seems sensible to see how the small changes impact things.  For bigger changes to the landing page it feels like we need 4 or 5 variations which could be kicked around by the various interested teams, and then perhaps we could A/B test a couple of alternatives if we can narrow down to two that we like.  The concern that Pat raised is that the landing page doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately communicate our value proposition, and I tend to agree with him.  I think there are also a great number of other tweaks that could be made in other places to make the whole site look more pleasing and professional - things like the disabled direct signup component, the excessive and small font size text in several places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our sprint kick off on Friday I&amp;rsquo;m adjusting the site so that newly signed up users will be redirected to the getting started page.  That feels like a survivable experiment that might deliver some value.  However for all this tweaking I don&amp;rsquo;t have much evidence that any of the AdWords activity will actually lead to revenue generation.  Clearly if we can get the site into the shape where it does act as a funnel for those who might really derive value from AgileVentures, then that would be fantastic.  However I suspect that most who are coming in through our &amp;ldquo;learning to code&amp;rdquo; related keywords might be better served by CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp.  Presumably if we carefully tweak our AdWords, over time we might be able to hit a seams of developers at junior, mid and senior level who&amp;rsquo;d want to get involved and take out Premium plans &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that so far the income we have has been generated by me reaching out directly to people via Email and Slack.  Getting people to sign up on our site of course swells the number we can email to, but then again if they are not the ones who&amp;rsquo;ll benefit from AgileVentures then it&amp;rsquo;s effort in vain.  Clearly the email newsletter needs to go out and we need to see what interest it generates.  I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to think that making some mobbing session videos available as examples of the benefits of Premium Mob might have more impact at the moment &amp;hellip; I guess we keep experimenting and analyzing AND visualizing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any Premium pairing this Sunday, and my twin boys&amp;rsquo; football match was rained off, so I had a relatively calm day, staying completely off Slack and Email.  I collapsed after lunch and slept for three hours - catching up lost sleep from the week where I&amp;rsquo;d been up in the night a few times.  The last couple of weeks haven&amp;rsquo;t been great sleep-wise.  A sudden alertness at 4am and then an inability to get back to sleep without listening to an hour of audio comedy.  Not that I don&amp;rsquo;t try just relaxing back into sleep, but after an hour of the same work and relationship thoughts going round in my head I get sick of it, and find audio comedy is a reasonably pleasant way of changing my internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do end up feeling a bit of a failure when Steve Hagen and Eckhart Tolle say that there&amp;rsquo;s a simple step to enlightenment or awakeness available in every moment, and that we&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to be equipped to realise it. I had lots of moments of awareness/self-observation over the weekend, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from blowing up in a rage at my kids on two or three occasions.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got to balance that against the points when I didn&amp;rsquo;t blow up in a rage, or didn&amp;rsquo;t resist the moment and wrestle it forcefully into something that it currently wasn&amp;rsquo;t.  It&amp;rsquo;s funny, but I see an analogy with the Empire Strikes Back where Yoda tells Luke that he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go off to help his friends (Han and Leia), because by turning aside from his main task he&amp;rsquo;ll threaten what they fight for.  Ironically Luke rushes to save his friends, but they save themselves and he isn&amp;rsquo;t the one who effects their escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved Star Wars growing up, but with the subsequent movies and a jaundiced adult eye it all seems rather trite and very militaristic; sort of glorifying a sanitised violence where no one actually bleeds.  Still I can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice that when I try to resist my children&amp;rsquo;s moods directly; when I try to prevent one from screaming their displeasure at another, that I seem to make the situation worse and not better.  Far more effective recently is not to resist their upset.  Naturally I still physically intervene if it&amp;rsquo;s actually coming to blows; but what I&amp;rsquo;m reducing is my protestations of &amp;ldquo;of course if you scream at him he&amp;rsquo;s not going to let you have it&amp;rdquo;, and so the reactions that I would get to those statements, e.g. &amp;ldquo;well he&amp;rsquo;s being rude to me and has made me upset!!&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t fly back at me.  If I try to control my kids behaviours too strongly what I get is lots of justifications from each child about why their own bad behaviour is inevitable as a result of the poor behaviour of other parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly a lot of adult conversations can go the same way, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been guilty in the past of making justification after justification, when I&amp;rsquo;m starting to realise that &amp;ldquo;defending your corner&amp;rdquo;, so to speak, has a tendency to provoke additional attack.  I still have huge trouble with statements I disagree with.  I really find it difficult not to respond to them.  I feel like not responding is somehow tacit agreement.  That letting a statement stand unopposed is tantamount to conceding that it is the truth.   That&amp;rsquo;s just my perception - is there any truth in it?  Do other people think that the last unopposed statement reflects the group concensus? I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to know &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday we had various meetings, and what I&amp;rsquo;m grudgingly realising more and more is that my tendency to challenge statements I disagree with can make for longer and longer meetings.  I think I actually did a better job than usual.  I stayed in the moment in one meeting, frustrated that someone had said something that contradicted my own assertion, but realising to confront it would be to drag out part of the meeting, when I was judging that actually it was more important to move on to other things.  Who knows if that was the right decision?  Like the foolish(?) neighbour who keeps congratulating the wise(?) farmer in the Zen riddle, when does the story ever end?  When do we find out the true extent of all the consequences of every decision?  Never?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the most important thing is not being taken over by the &amp;ldquo;unconscious&amp;rdquo; reaction to any situation?  Let the situation be; give yourself time to observe your internal mental state and then allow a &amp;ldquo;conscious&amp;rdquo; reaction to emerge?  Will that allow things to get better?  Let&amp;rsquo;s not attach ourselves to outcomes.  Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on being conscious in the current moment.  Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the way to achieve true balance &amp;hellip; but then life&amp;rsquo;s such a complex puzzle, could managing it really be that simple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I got disenchanted with academia was the process of writing grant applications for research funds.  It seemed to involve a huge amount of work to describe the work you would do if someone gave you some money.  There&amp;rsquo;d be several weeks&amp;rsquo; work writing a 10 or 20 page document followed by an all-nighter to get it all together for the deadline and then submit through some complex web interface.  Then wait six months to get three or four paragraphs of feedback about why the proposal hadn&amp;rsquo;t been accepted.  While some people in academia were successful recipients of government grants, I was much more successful in bringing in industry money where I could talk to someone face to face.  The problem with industry grants is that they would dry up when the market turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, fast forward to my current focus on charities and freelancing.  It&amp;rsquo;s grant writing all over again, although the turn-around time is a bit faster.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving a lot of support from lovely people in the charity sector regarding fund-raising, but I seem to be back in this situation of asking for money and getting turned down for one reason or another.  I wonder if the problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m always hedging my bets.  Being completely unable to quantify the chances of receiving a grant, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to work out how much effort to put into the application process.  I just went through one where the person guiding me was saying we were pretty much guaranteed to get the contract, just to be phoned late last night and told that another bidder had unexpectedly been able to come in and offer an existing solution and point to a much stronger background in the area the grant was focused on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I&amp;rsquo;ll have to make it clear that phoning me late at night is not on.  I&amp;rsquo;m involved in a couple of other bids for freelance work at the moment.  All of them difficult to quantify in terms of how much money they&amp;rsquo;ll bring in and the likelihood of actually landing them.  I&amp;rsquo;ll give it till April and then I&amp;rsquo;ll have to put the search for income into a higher gear &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that speculative bidding process juxtaposes with moments of coding zen I&amp;rsquo;ve felt this week.  I was tidying up the three WSO PRs I made this week while my twin boys were doing their Karate class, and starting to add comments about issues I was seeing.  I managed to pull some logic out of a view into a helper, so that the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Want to learn more? Listen in. Next projects review meeting '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;became&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;event_name_or_invitation_to_guest_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Want to learn more? Listen in. Next projects review meeting '&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in &lt;code&gt;layout_helper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;making the original erb become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event_name_or_invitation_to_guest_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which I think is an improvement.  I think the intent is conveyed a little more succinctly now, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that LayoutHelper is necessarily the best place for the code, but one thing at a time.  Getting that in place and adding a few &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1566"&gt;inline comments on my own PR&lt;/a&gt; I experienced a moment of coding zen.  My concerns about a couple of places in the code were addressed with changes, and I was recording other concerns.  Next step&amp;ndash;refactoring tickets.  The Zen feeling came from a brief sensation of wholeness - that it was okay for the code to have issues, but that we have a mechanism for addressing those issues over time.  Now if only there was some way to achieve a similar Zen state as regards funding applications :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after taking a full week away from Slack and Email I managed to start work again without too much obsessive checking of Slack and Email on my phone.  At least for the last ten days I&amp;rsquo;m not checking it when I first wake up and, instead, leaving it till after my morning blog.  I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much avoiding looking at it during the evenings, although I tend to have a last Slack check around 9:30pm when I post my blog.  Pretty good for a week and a half, but last night I ended up looking at my email while my eldest was reading to me, and then this morning I ended up looking at it while I was getting dressed, as I tried to send myself a reminder email.  There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything urgent to deal with, but in both cases I did manage to load chunks of work worry into my mind.  And then just now I seem to have reviewed all my Email and Slack before getting down to the blog.  There wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much to deal with, but I feel a little unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need to move the Slack and Email icons on my phone deeper into a nested directory and make sure that I shut down Slack and Email when I finish on my laptop each day, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally look at them before blogging.  My tweet/slacking of the podcast I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to in the morning interferes with that.  I guess I should get into the habit of tweeting and then re-posting that to Slack after the morning blog is completed.  Not that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I&amp;rsquo;m achieving much with the blogging.  It may be an interesting historical record to look back on for me.  Not sure about anyone else :-)   I continue to post out older blogs on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@tansakuu"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.  My blogs from last October were much more coding focused, and my rambling blogs don&amp;rsquo;t compare favourably (in my mind) with the ultra-focused &amp;ldquo;learn this!&amp;rdquo; blogs that others stamp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s March and I committed to myself to keep daily blogging to June and I like to stick to my commitments.  I am getting a bit of coding done this week, following the WebSiteOne kick off with Michael and Raoul last Friday.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got three pull-requests open, one for each of the three tickets I committed to working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1564"&gt;spikes some example tooltips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1566"&gt;less intimidating invitations to scrums for non-logged in users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1568"&gt;adjust intial messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re all relatively simple view changes.  Most of the work so far has been fixing failing regression tests (i.e. other tests that were relying on the view looking a certain way).  Some of it is a bit spikey.  I&amp;rsquo;ve created acceptance tests in Cucumber for the last two, and the middle one above has some logic in the view that I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to pull out.  The blog from early Feb that I was reviewing last night also spiked something with a fair amount of code in the view.  Early February I was focused on getting the escalating call to action out, in the hope that it might impact the number of people upgrading to Premium plans, but as far as I can see it&amp;rsquo;s had no impact.  We&amp;rsquo;ve had a new Premium Mob member join, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s come entirely through Slack interaction.  Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a value in the long run with the name of the next upgrade being repeated to folks whenever they are coming to the site, but then again we&amp;rsquo;re not really tracking how often the different types of member view the home page &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1569"&gt;refactoring ticket&lt;/a&gt; to pull code out of the &amp;ldquo;escalating call to action&amp;rdquo; view.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard Armando say &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t put code in your views&amp;rdquo; umpteen times as I&amp;rsquo;ve re-viewed the MOOC videos. Clearly coding in ERB isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty - moving the code into a helper would reduce the number of symbols to look at.  It could go in a presenter, or be refactored into a model.  The code in the current feature I&amp;rsquo;m working on is less heinous.  That&amp;rsquo;s just the addition of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Want to learn more? Listen in. Next projects review meeting '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with the look and feel of the site, I find it easier just to be focusing on a single file.  The code in the escalating call for action view is more heinous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Basic'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium for additional support'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Premium'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;plan: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'premiummob'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium Mob for group sessions with a Mentor'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_user_registration_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Get started now to begin coding!'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to pull the logic from either into the controller.  The code could be going into the Event or User models, but that feels like overloading them.  What we have here is sort of business logic about how we communicate with the different types of user.  Would it help to get the strings into the I18n setup so that we can refer to them via a constant string, the meaning of which can be looked up in a text file?  Or is that getting distracted from the business logic experiments we are trying to carry out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is refactoring these things for code cleanliness pulling time that could be spent on measuring their impact more accurately?  My temptation is to deploy the new language and see if the Scrum masters conclude that more new folks are coming into online hangouts.  That&amp;rsquo;s effectively what I&amp;rsquo;ve done for the &amp;ldquo;escalating call to action&amp;rdquo;.  I&amp;rsquo;m set up to be alerted whenever anyone signs up for a Premium plan and I&amp;rsquo;m in regular contact with all the Scrum masters.  Setting up extra code for measurement seems excessive at this stage.  I&amp;rsquo;m confused; what&amp;rsquo;s the distraction and what&amp;rsquo;s the focus? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad we had this chat though - I&amp;rsquo;m thinking a presenter object is the way to go and that it might make the business logic clearer for the point when we want to focus on that without being distracted :-)&lt;/p&gt;
