&lt;p&gt;Having estsablished that MediaWiki&amp;rsquo;s default and visual editors both worked smoothly on the NHS laptops on the NHS intranet, it seemed pretty much wrapped up that we&amp;rsquo;d be using MediaWiki for the NHS Social Prescribing project.  The question then became whether we should host it ourselves or use a third party hosting service.  The main MediaWiki site provides a &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hosting_services"&gt;list of hosting services&lt;/a&gt; which are sortable in terms of different features.  I pulled out all the offerings that included visual editor support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://meta.miraheze.org/"&gt;Miraheze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mywikis.com/"&gt;MyWikis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki-valley.com/"&gt;Wiki Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wikibase.nl/Diensten/Managed_hosting"&gt;Wikibase solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list also included Wikia and Gamepedia, both free with advertising and both targeting the video-game/entertainment market.  Possible, but long shots I thought; for healthcare we&amp;rsquo;d want a more serious tone.  I contacted all four of the above organisations to try and get set up with a test wiki with a visual editor installed.  Miraheze&amp;rsquo;s site didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately load so I got on to the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MyWikis gave me access to their testing wiki sandbox which had the visual editor; but it got stuck loading on all the browsers I tried and although they responded to my help request reasonably promptly, their suggestion that I should try browser refreshes until it worked was not very helpful.  Wiki Valley responded to my request to say they would create a dedicated demo wiki for us as well as giving us access to a sandbox, but I still haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to edit a page anywhere despite several attempts.  The notification emails and the site are in French and they&amp;rsquo;re not filling me with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikibase didn&amp;rsquo;t want to provide a demo environment and said that they only minimally support the visual editor. Instead they focus on semantic wiki and page forms as that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;re saying their users want.  Sounds like an interesting future possibility (submitting data to wikis via forms) but not the best short term option.  Conversely, Miraheze is a volunteer-run system receiving donations to pay for hosting and have no guarantees of service in their terms and conditions, but they have actually been the fastest to set up a working test site for us and the only MediaWiki hosting service to get us a working visual editor so far.  I had to log into a separate feature requesting system (Phabricator) to get the visual editor enabled, and their site has been responsive all week since that outage I experienced the first time I went to their main site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel I used &lt;a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mediawiki"&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; which allowed a very simple deploy to our own MediaWiki instance on Azure where we can config the MediaWiki directly, and I was able to adjust the main logo and do some preliminary testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m honing in on a set of technical features we need to support the higher level project requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WYSIWYG editor (optional initially, but might be crucial down the line &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can disable anonymous edits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we insert custom HLP header to make it look like part of HLP site &amp;hellip;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moderation support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my next priority must be to request all the additional features enabled we need in the hlptest.miraheze.org MediaWiki, and then see how quickly I can set them up in parallel on our own server.  I started by &lt;a href="https://phabricator.miraheze.org/T1720"&gt;requesting the disabling of anonymous edits&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="requesting disabling of anonymous edits on miraheze via phabricator" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ecfs2s49des8xmj/Screenshot%202017-04-26%2009.46.45.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s see how quickly I can do this on our Bitnami/Azure system.  First I need to log in to azure.bitnami.com, which gives me a screen showing both the link to our running instance, and the ssh credentials I need to ssh directly into the box where I can edit the mediawiki settings.  I&amp;rsquo;d previously updated the logo by editing &lt;code&gt;/apps/mediawiki/htdocs/LocalSettings.php&lt;/code&gt;.  So I went back there to try to disable anonymous edits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Preventing&lt;em&gt;access#Restrict&lt;/em&gt;anonymous_editing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I needed to go to &lt;code&gt;includes/DefaultSettings.php&lt;/code&gt; and set the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage'] = false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I had successfully disabled the ability of anonymous users to edit existing pages or create new pages.  Meanwhile I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for Miraheze to process my request.  I might rue the day since it may well be a total pain to set up the visual editor or SSL on our Bitnami/Azure hosted system, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can use Miraheze for anything other than testing purposes, since we&amp;rsquo;ll need server side access to fix things ourselves in a hurry if we have a specific request from the NHS team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe ideally I&amp;rsquo;d now spend the rest of the day working through all the other features in turn.  In the first instance I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just request them all from Miraheze and then see if I can knock off a couple of other low hanging fruit.  Although as I look I see that file upload appears to be enabled by default, and there are just restrictions about which sorts of files can be uploaded.  HLP is asking about uploading Excel files, which sounds like something we can easily add later as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miraheze has a &lt;a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Custom_domains"&gt;whole page on how to request custom domains&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know when an HLP subdomain will be created for us, so it&amp;rsquo;s expedient to see if we can set up subdomains on av.org and see if we can get our Bitnami/Azure box hooked up like that.  That reminds me we will really need SSL (something Miraheze has out of the box), and in general we need to improve our Azure admin skills.  If only AWS or DO had given us similar nonprofit credit schemes &amp;hellip; guess I could try a Bitnami deploy to AWS and taking the financial hit, but we do need to skill up in Azure admin for the AsyncVoter project and to take advantage of the credits from MicroSoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve set up http://hlp-wiki.agileventures.org to point to our Azure/Bitnami system, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that works, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait for the zone file to propagate.  For stability we&amp;rsquo;ll need to reserve the IP address which requires powershell installation.  I also see an article for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate"&gt;ssl setup&lt;/a&gt;.  It might be painful but I think we can get all that done.  The other things to impale ourselves on are setting up the WYSIWYG editor, working out the moderation strategy and whether/how we can have an HLP banner across the top of the wiki &amp;hellip; stay tuned for all those fun and frolics in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is April 25th, the day that Google shuts down its Hangout API.  We&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this coming for several months, with Google enterprise support hinting at a replacement.  Yesterday (April 24th) all the hangout apps stopped functioning and our scrum hosts were forced back to taking the hangout URLs and pasting them into the site to update the site link and notify Slack (as we had done during a previous Google Hangout API outage).  The &amp;ldquo;Start a Hangout on Air&amp;rdquo; buttons were still working, but are now mainly serving to cause the disabled hangout apps to load into the hangout, which requires (all?) users to click &amp;ldquo;cancel&amp;rdquo; a couple of times before the hangout will start sharing video or screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve been derelict in my duty by failing to spend the last three months thoroughly researching and implementing an alternate solution.  The approach I&amp;rsquo;ve taken is to wait and see what&amp;rsquo;s left after the Hangout API is retired.  It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating.  We&amp;rsquo;ve poured hundreds of hours into the Google Hangout plugins, and the data we get from them underpins a lot of our site&amp;rsquo;s Karma metric and our ability to analyse and track pairing and scrumming in the AgileVentures site and the edX MOOC.  The MOOC is just about to start again and realistically we&amp;rsquo;ll have no telemetry on any pairing.  That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve just got an email saying that the whole AgileVentures site will have to be overhauled for accessibility if it&amp;rsquo;s going to be linked to the edX MOOC.  Maybe going forward we just won&amp;rsquo;t be able to have a direct link pointing our MOOC students to pair using our system.  Early days - lots to review and work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of continuing the day to day business of AgileVentures: scrums, meetings and the occasional pairing session, we are still in principle able to use the hangouts.  It&amp;rsquo;s a usability pain, but regular members will be able to learn how to update the events in the AV site manually.  It generates a series of action items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Inform members individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Update documentation in AV to indicate new approach to taking hangouts live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Update documentation in edX MOOC about new strategy (or remove entirely)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of the interface element that allows anyone to update an event hangout link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="interface element that allows anyone to update an event hangout link" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6soei7ibumpmym/Screenshot%202017-04-24%2016.16.49.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we don&amp;rsquo;t support a manual function for distributing the video link, which is something we might want to add.  That and the manual mechanism might make sharing the meeting links less arduous, but they don&amp;rsquo;t address the tracking/telemetry elements that we&amp;rsquo;re losing, or the awareness components that show who is in a meeting and whether it is still live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google appears to be splitting Hangouts into two separate products, &amp;ldquo;meet&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;chat&amp;rdquo;.  I can now start Google &amp;ldquo;meets&amp;rdquo; through my enterprise account.  They appear to be hangouts with all the apps and chat removed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Meet" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xd8bp268seota88/Screenshot%202017-04-25%2009.50.08.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet I can find no mention of an API.   I&amp;rsquo;ve applied for the Early Adopter Program (EAP) for chat, but haven&amp;rsquo;t gained access yet.  I can guess some of Google&amp;rsquo;s motivation for splitting the two products in terms of simpler offerings, but it goes in a completely different direction from what we want.  We&amp;rsquo;d like more tightly integrated chat and videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need to back up and work out what&amp;rsquo;s really mission critical for AgileVentures.  What&amp;rsquo;s mission critical for me is delivering on the NHS project so I can feed my kids.  My intuition is that being able to start video events from Slack would be much more convenient and comprehensible for everyone.  It&amp;rsquo;s possible and the de-motivator for me in the past is that those hangouts haven&amp;rsquo;t been recordable; but maybe we need to drop that recording aspect?  The pros are that it&amp;rsquo;s great for learning, openneess, accessibilty, catching up etc., but knowing you&amp;rsquo;ll be recorded is a big barrier for some folks.  We&amp;rsquo;ve got some different technology options to pursue such as seeing whether we could use Zoom, or a hand-rolled WebRTC solution, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got limited development resources.  Before we start spending them I&amp;rsquo;d like to do a full week design sprint to prototype and test the next solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels a bit like the end of the line for the moment.  The AgileVentures events page &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1635"&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t loading at all yesterday&lt;/a&gt; due to a 500 error we couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand (some 3rd party service timing out perhaps?), but seems to be working today.  I guess change is the only certainty.  We&amp;rsquo;ve built a community using the free offerings that companies like Slack and Google have provided us, but it was always without guarantees.  Relationships with partners change, and everyone will have mixed feelings when those relationships change, but change they must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I spent a good couple of hours shutting down all the different browser tabs I had open (about 70) and adding relevant links to my action plan.  I got briefly distracted updating the Wikipedia pages for Social Prescribing, but that felt good to get done, and ultimately I was able to reboot my computer before doing a Premium pairing on EventManager with Marian, where we managed to tinker with the existing pull request. We had to change the styling on the event when it went live.  We managed to use an html data-attribute so that the styling and display of the event live status was always managed by JavaScript &amp;hellip; Would love to pull the code into the blog, but in the meantime check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/EventManager/pull/27"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was an early Monday start to get down to NHS head offices to meet up with new and outgoing change managers.  It was the outgoing change manager&amp;rsquo;s last day, so important to catch them to say goodbye and thank them for the work they&amp;rsquo;d done so far.  On the way in on the train I sketched an agenda for the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking how things were going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double checking on what success looked like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting approval for my plan going forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the content from the PDFs into the wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarifying the communication plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened we jumped in in the middle and I ended up telling them the outcome of my testing with the NHS laptop on Friday, and how I&amp;rsquo;d landed on MediaWiki as a solution to our problems there.  I also ended up showing them the Bitnami hosted MediaWiki I&amp;rsquo;d set up and the Social Prescribing page on Wikipedia.  They seemed pleased to see the progress and a Social Prescribing page, and I talked them through how moderation works on Wikipedia.  In mentioning the Wikipedia page on the doctor, Michael Dixon, we discovered that there is an NHS wikiproject group within Wikipedia.  That seems like an important lead - folks that we might be able to reach out to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about the timeline, the communication strategy options, and setting up editing and moderation training for HLP staff and others to fit in with the idea of a soft launch on May 4th and hard launch on May 12th.  We also had a chance to double check that the Bitnami/Azure hosted MediaWiki worked on the NHS laptops.  I was pretty sure there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any problems, but after the icon issue the previous week I wanted to double check.  The icons all loaded.  I note that I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually check a successful edit operation - will follow up with the new change manager to make double sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also sat down with team lead, to check in that everything was solid.  Sounds like the conference they wants to present the system at, on May 18th, is a big deal, with VIPs etc. and they&amp;rsquo;ll want to do a live demo if possible &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was glad that I asked the new change manager about how things were going generally as I heard about some of the other HLP activities, including that they were tendering for a social prescribing service to be set up in collaboration with a CCG.  I had assumed that HLP&amp;rsquo;s activities were limited to researching social prescribing, rather than taking an active lead on setting it up, so that was good to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all left me with a good set of action items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting the legal review of the terms &amp;amp; conditions signed and sealed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double check with the new change manager that they can complete a mediawiki edit on their laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arranging meetings with the remaining stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviewing all the MediaWiki hosting options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring we have the right kind of moderation options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating editing and moderation training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get us a URL &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote these up on the train home, where I saw an interesting health care related advertisement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="UNISON tube advert" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xkam0b5hthm8hu8/unison-advert.JPG?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is everything connected?  I&amp;rsquo;m steeling myself for the big push to get this all live &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just burnt 15 minutes taking out the recycling, replenishing the water bottles on my desk and discussing with my wife about Japanese textbooks for my kids.  Well not burnt :-) Time spent - all needed to be done.  If I&amp;rsquo;d been slightly more organised I&amp;rsquo;d have gotten my eldest son to take out the recycling this morning.  The strange thing about being a parent is that getting time when you&amp;rsquo;re not being pestered or interrupted is quite hard.  All my boys are at school now - I get a certain amount of time in the day when I can focus on my computer in my home office where I have two external screens and I can work &amp;ldquo;efficiently&amp;rdquo;.  The &amp;ldquo;in the momment&amp;rdquo; philosophy suggests to me that it&amp;rsquo;s a little silly to consider time as burnt or lost; at the same time I do want to bring in money to feed my kids, and that seems to require focused time getting work done.  That said and despite my best efforts at prioritisiing, I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m really focusing properly on what will bring home the bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having used up a lot of my savings to work on AgileVentures full time for the last year I am definitely in a bit of an anxious state.  I did achieve a couple of breakthroughs yesterday that did help to lighten my mood.  One was to find a WYSIWYG editor that worked on the NHS laptops.  The other was to resurrect the autograders for the AV102 TA training course.  Both are good stories I&amp;rsquo;d like to blog out.  I also note that I&amp;rsquo;m well behind on reviewing LocalSupport pull requests and many other things.  I&amp;rsquo;m torn about whether to use the blogging time to force a focus on catching up with AgileVentures Premium related work (e.g. pull requests) and reporting on the breakthroughs.  Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the breakthroughs for the purpose of self-documentation and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the pull requests in the next chunk of my day and blog about them Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was at the NHS head office again yesterday for a meeting with a member of the communications team, which was a critical meeting and very positive.  The communications person was enthusiastic about the proposed social-prescription wiki, and naturally concerned that many of the stakeholders might find it difficult to contribute.  More on the details of that meeting soon, but just after the meeting I was able to sit down with an NHS laptop (with IE 11 on the NHS intranet) and review the problematic interface issues we&amp;rsquo;d seen in the usability sessions a fortnight before.  For the usability testing we&amp;rsquo;d selected three different wikis and tested them on NHS staff computers.  The wikis had worked, but the key problem across all three instances (PBwiki, XWiki, BlueSpice) was that certain key icons just didn&amp;rsquo;t show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="XWiki icons not showing up" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/il7lzum1kbx6ev3/Screenshot%202017-04-21%2009.40.08.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above image you can see how the login panel for XWiki looks on my Mac, and on the left you can see how it looks in IE11 on the NHS laptops.  The icons are missing.  Now that&amp;rsquo;s not the end of the world for this login panel, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually catastrophic in terms of usability for the rest of the XWiki, and not just XWiki, but also PBWorks and BlueSpice.   The XWiki &amp;ldquo;hamburger&amp;rdquo; drawer icon that serves to indicate where to open the login panel is not visible on the NHS laptops, so you can&amp;rsquo;t login without someone standing next to you telling you where to click.  On PBworks and BlueSpice the icons are used to indicate the place to click to start editing, or to use various text font and styling buttons.  Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from BlueSpice, which for some reason had also switched to Russian:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BlueSpice text editing toolbar on the NHS laptop" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpc9vqhyj0yzgl6/Screenshot%202017-04-21%2009.45.05.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly all these icons loaded correctly on a virtualized IE 11 on my laptop running over the NHS guest wifi.  The failure of the icons to show up was only happening on the NHS laptops hard linked to their internal network.  What I really should have done was tethered one of their laptops to my wifi hotspot on my phone to further isolate the problem, but I was out of time, and the suggestions from XWiki support, such as clearing the browser cache, were not possible on the sys-admin restricted NHS laptops.  I took lots of screenshots, dumped network interactions and noted that the failures for XWiki were for the Glyphicons, for PBwiki they were font-awesome icons, and for BlueSpice they were MCE Editor icons.  It was a dark moment - in my desparation I tried loading Wikipedia on the NHS laptop, and the icons in their basic editor showed up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wikipedia basic editor working" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kwtz5ebey0jmug/Screenshot%202017-04-21%2009.49.52.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I investigated the source and found that they were using background images rather than icons.  I&amp;rsquo;d initially ruled out a pure mediawiki offering, with the special mediawiki syntax as being too confusing for the majority of stakeholders, but I noticed that Wikipedia offered a visual editor solution that also worked on the NHS laptop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wikipedia visual editor" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ltrfl1c0ha10cy/Screenshot%202017-04-21%2009.52.42.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we have a winner?  At least I had an angle of attack.  If MediaWiki actually worked on NHS laptops then it was streets ahead of any other solution we&amp;rsquo;d tested so far, regardless of any other shortcomings.  Still lots to work out, but light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was one breakthrough.  The trip into London for the NHS meeting and then the laptop research, getting home, investigating options for MediaWiki hosting left me having spent no time on my other major blocker which was that the legacy autograders for the AV102 TA training course weren&amp;rsquo;t working.  I&amp;rsquo;d logged into the grader earlier in the week and got the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;The queue name is BerkeleyX-cs169x
/home/ubuntu/rag/lib/edx_controller.rb:74:in `get_queue_length': Bad queue length response:  (EdXController::BadStatusCodeError)
        from /home/ubuntu/rag/lib/edx_client.rb:242:in `each_submission'
        from /home/ubuntu/rag/lib/edx_client.rb:49:in `run'
        from ./run_edx_client.rb:9:in `&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over.  The AV102 grader hadn&amp;rsquo;t been updated to the new version that UCBerkeley students created the summer before last.  I&amp;rsquo;d fixed the AV102 grader to keep running, about the same time last year, by hacking away at the authentication code, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimistic that I could fix it again.  The &amp;ldquo;sensible&amp;rdquo; path would be taking all the AV102 assignments and converting their specifications to work with the new grader and then pointing the AV102 course on edX to a new grader instance.  The problem with that path is that it felt like it would be multiple hours work, with no guarantee of success.  In principle the new grader system is supposed to allow us to insert new assignments more easily - the assignment specification can be located in GitHub and be sent to the grader via the edX course itself.  I&amp;rsquo;m 90% sure that I could get it all working, but it feels like it would take a few hours, with bumps and starts, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a few hours.  Or at least didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I could make space for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prodded at the failing grader code for five minutes and saw that the problem on the legacy grader was again an authentication issue.  The initial authentication step was not working, causing the request to the edX queues to be redirected to login.  This was exactly the problem I&amp;rsquo;d fixed a couple of times before in under an hour of debugging, and the exciting thing in both those cases was that all the existing infrastructure would then start working.  No need to convert multiple assignments to a different format etc.  However the day was at an end, and my physio had now cleared me to join in my sons&amp;rsquo; karate classes.  What to do?  I took my laptop to Karate and sat out.  Fortuitously, just as the Karate class was finishing and I had to take my sons home, I&amp;rsquo;d done it again.  Analysing how mechanise (which the TAs had used in the new grader) was successfully authenticating on the new grader develop server, I saw that again we had a problem in the legacy code as to how the &amp;ldquo;Set-Cookie&amp;rdquo; operation was being interpreted.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what the edX queues was sending back in response to authentication requests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"set-cookie"=&amp;gt;"csrftoken=kFWOZK6FnT....eLAvMDsyi; expires=Thu, 19-Apr-2018 17:15:44 GMT; Max-Age=31449600; Path=/, sessionid=y4i9hip...j3x1i; expires=Thu, 04-May-2017 17:15:44 GMT; httponly; Max-Age=1209600; Path=/, AWSELB=E7E741EF08F209.....E1C1FA69F3B681EB87F2DFC9E7C01B23665183B022A6A8E876;PATH=/", "vary"=&amp;gt;"Accept-Encoding, Cookie", "content-length"=&amp;gt;"61", "connection"=&amp;gt;"keep-alive"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With debugging hooks going down through a couple of gems, I determined that the working mechanise based grader was only setting the csrftoken, sessionid and AWSELB elements of the set cookie request.   I got the same effect on the legacy code with a really messy hack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@session_cookie = all_cookies.scan(/[\d\w]+\=[\d\w]+/).select{|str| str.start_with?('AWSELB') ||str.start_with?('csrftoken') || str.start_with?('sessionid')}.join('; ')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it worked - suddenly the AV102 homeworks were grading successfully.  Such a mess, and it could have been concealing many other bugs behind the authentication failure, but I gambled and won on this occasion.  I&amp;rsquo;m not getting paid anything to work on this code or run the AV102 training course.  It would be hugely beneficial for the long term of the autograder project if I was regularly inserting new assignments into the new system, documenting the process and smoothing off the rough edges, but again, no one is paying for that.  Or at least, no one is paying me for that.  I do get a share of the proceeds of the sales of the relaeted textbook (since I&amp;rsquo;m the editor) and part of my responsibility is to keep the graders running on the main course and the SPOC, but the TA training course is my own separate initiative.  Ironically this messy hack in 45 minutes in my free time while my kids do Karate will keep the AV102 TA training course running for a little longer.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t even had time to take the debugger statements out of the develop grader (although a git checkout should sort that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two breakthroughs, but I&amp;rsquo;m still anxious.  Is this hack to keep AV102 running a wonderful piece of pragmatism, or is it the technical debt that breaks the camel&amp;rsquo;s back?  Can I find a good MediaWiki hosting provider or will we have to host ourselves?  Lots of deep breaths, nose to the grindstone, enjoy the moment! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging helps me get my thoughts straight in the morning.  Well, I say blogging&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m just doing the morning pages exercise that some writers apparently use.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any particular requirement to blog them; but it&amp;rsquo;s somehow painful for me not to publish whatever I&amp;rsquo;m generating.  That&amp;rsquo;s maybe part of my problem, in that I suspect that I might connect with more folks if I spent more time revising and polishing before sharing, but who knows?  I got some good feedback off the &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/03/17/private-pairing/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I shared in Slack last night.  At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m trying to hold the course till June when I&amp;rsquo;ll have been compulsively blogging for a year.  I&amp;rsquo;ve previously thought that after that I might switch to one blog a week. In the shower this morning I thought about whether it would be interesting to do one private pairing session a day rather than blogging.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also had an idea that maybe a series of pair programming videos with relatively well-known programmers might be fun and help towards the vision of a more active pair programming community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just had a strange brain fork (or trident?) experience where my mind went in three different directions at almost the same time - or at least kept switching back and forth between three or more different topics.  Partly there&amp;rsquo;s this process before blogging in the morning where I start to think about what I want to blog about, and then sometimes I sit down and the text goes off in a different direction, and sometimes I want to go with the flow, and sometimes I can&amp;rsquo;t bear to leave things out.  On this occasion I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear to leave anything out and so I make four sets of notes in draft below that I now plan to turn into four separate paragraphs - here are (hopefully) those four paragraphs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the subject of compulsive blogging, I was relieved to hear &lt;a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/podcast/episode-016-julia-evans/"&gt;Julan Evans talking on GreaterThanCode&lt;/a&gt; about how she &lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/"&gt;blogs intensively&lt;/a&gt; on all sorts of tech topics, and makes me feel that I&amp;rsquo;m not such an insane blogging hermit that I sometimes deride myself internally for.  Looking over her blogs like &lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/08/05/pair-programming-is-amazing-except-when-its-not/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pair programming is amazing! Except&amp;hellip; when it&amp;rsquo;s not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; I see a higher quality that I can aspire to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After blogging, myself, about &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/03/17/private-pairing/"&gt;private pairing sessions&lt;/a&gt; I wondered if after June I should spend my blogging time on private pairing.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently spending over an hour on blog activities each day with at least 30 minutes writing in the morning (plus research) and then another 30 in the evening (reviewing a blog from one month back to push to AV nonprofit site and AV slack, and one blog from 3 months back to push to Medium, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn).  Of course private pairing sessions wouldn&amp;rsquo;t include videos to blog, but perhaps I could tweet who I was pairing with?  To be honest I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to spend almost all my day blogging and pairing with different folks, private, public and everywhere in-between.  In some ways, on a mission to work out a framework that will allow that activity to feed my kids as well, although I am really enjoying design sprints and talking to clients.  Design sprints online, now there&amp;rsquo;s a thought &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, if I want to be blogging about pairing sessions in more detail, one model could be to reach out to well-known programmers and produce a series of video blogs more like 
&lt;a href="https://www.driftingruby.com/"&gt;https://www.driftingruby.com/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sub.watchmecode.net/"&gt;https://sub.watchmecode.net/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://scaleyourcode.com/"&gt;https://scaleyourcode.com/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s interviews with experts.  All of these seem much more accessible and polished than the blizzard of adhoc pairing sessions we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded at AgileVentures.  Maybe we just need a load of venture capital to build the perfect system to support the different levels of public and private pairing?  Of course we&amp;rsquo;re a charity &amp;hellip; perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a venture philanthropist out there who can help us make it happen? :-)  Or is it just too much to try and build a new social-technical collaboration framework AND try and direct its engine towards charitable goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the orphaned blog topic that I had wanted to get into today was the great Elixir mobbing session that we had yesterday.  I&amp;rsquo;d been away for a week, and was really pleased to see the mob continue in my absence and the team get Elixir Phoenix set up on C9.  We carried on through Stephen Grider&amp;rsquo;s Phoenix tutorial and completed a new route and controller.  The mobbing is private, and only for AgileVentures Premium Mob members.  Of course my internal extrovert just wants to share and share the videos, but part of AgileVentures&amp;rsquo; sustainability is trying to create something that folks will put down some money for so we can ultimately pay staff to cover the gaps that appear when volunteers turn over.  AgileVentures Premium F2F is private pairing sessions, although I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make that all about working on AgileVentures open source charity projects.  Maybe that needs to change? Or the pairing community should be at least slighltly de-coupled from the charity projects?  It&amp;rsquo;s agonising.  People are so much more comfortable pairing privately on their own projects, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much great learning for them and for others if they paired publicly on charity projects.  I guess the trick will be to build a nice pathway from one to the other that people can move along at their preferred pace &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ll keep blogging &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into jogging, but still not getting up early enough to really reap much time from my wife taking the twins to school in the morning.  I maybe got an extra five minutes at the computer.  I burned at least three times that trying to use my phone to tweet the podcast from my morning run.  Hopefully by the end of the week I&amp;rsquo;ll be back in rhythm and be social-mediaing effectively again.  It&amp;rsquo;s lovely to get &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;retweets&amp;rdquo; when I send out stuff about other folks&amp;rsquo; podcasts.  I&amp;rsquo;ve half a hope that in the long run it might help me distribute my blogs to a wider audience, but I won&amp;rsquo;t get my hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to blog more about NHS meetings in the design sprint this morning, but it took forty minutes to review the six blogs from before the break to get my mind back to the point about what was the next thing I was supposed to be blogging about.  Specifically it&amp;rsquo;s details from meeting with a social prescription service provider, and an academic studying the same.  However there&amp;rsquo;s a question mark over what can be published about the NHS in these blogs, which should be resolved in a meeting tomorrow, so I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to hold fire till then.  In addition I&amp;rsquo;ve got quite a painful time anxiety at the moment about whether I&amp;rsquo;m allocating my time efficiently on different projects.  I have found another couple of grants I could apply for, and I need to do prep for the elixir mob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the NHS blogs has helped me recall all the detail of that previous week, but now I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to remember what I did yesterday.  I know we managed to have a Redeemify meeting where we worked out we should make a video demo-ing the current system for Armando.  We got Alex, Matt and Michael talking about fixes on WebSiteOne and dropping this priority project idea.  I met with drie to start testing more of their latest system, and I really can&amp;rsquo;t recall what I did before lunch.  I know I spent a chunk of time looking at different Drupal installations (with an eye on the wikis we might use for the NHS project), and managed to speak to the NHS Communications person on the phone, and realised that we really need them in as an expert witness for the design sprint (meeting planned for Thursday).  I re-watched the Martin Fowler scrum from yesterday to try and remind myself and that didn&amp;rsquo;t help - I feel like I lost a chunk of time yesterday morning.  I think it probably went to reviewing all the email and Slack messages that were still backed up from my week off, reaching out to mentors to see if they are interested in being sponsored for agile/scrum certifications (answer is yes and no), and tweaking the AV business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh what a flurry of different bits and pieces.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s deep breathing to manage the time anxiety and once more unto the breach, dear friends! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
