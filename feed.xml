&lt;p&gt;Another day, another five or so Premium records to review - let&amp;rsquo;s get started.  I update the starting date of another early Premium sign up and email them to see how they are doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):001:0&amp;gt; u = User.find_by email: '...'
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;User ...&amp;gt;
irb(main):002:0&amp;gt; u.subscription
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Premium id: .., type: "Premium", started_at: "2016-10-25 16:46:56", ended_at: nil, user_id: ..., plan_id: 1, sponsor_id: nil&amp;gt;
irb(main):003:0&amp;gt; u.subscription.started_at = DateTime.parse("2016-10-15 11:37:08")
=&amp;gt; Sat, 15 Oct 2016 11:37:08 +0000
irb(main):004:0&amp;gt; u.save
=&amp;gt; true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do pretty much the same thing for three more members, and reach out to each of them as well.  One of them is a member who pays their own way for Premium and is sponsored for an upgrade to Mob and to F2F - not sure how we represent that, but the first subscription I update is just their Premium account, so leave that as is I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blurgh, I am not getting very far each morning - distracted by Slack/Email, early Premium F2F trial sessions eating into my mornings &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Digging into Premium Data</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="digging in" src="/images/digging-in.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got stuck in to reviewing the Premium data from our API.  It was slow going, but at least I started.  Hoping I can plow through a chunk today.  Starting with our first ever Premium member, I reach out them to say hi and check how they are doing.  The next is a long term Premium who cancelled recently.  I see that they also deleted their account from AgileVentures a few days before reaching out to me in person.  I can sense that members would love to be able to cancel without having to interact with a human - perhaps we should prioritise that functionality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also notice that the starting dates for a few members are off, probably reflecting us adding in data structures after the first few members had signed up.  Using the Stripe dashboard to get the initial creation dates I adjust that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):007:0&amp;gt; u.subscription.ended_at = Date.parse('15-11-2017')
=&amp;gt; Wed, 15 Nov 2017
irb(main):008:0&amp;gt; u.save
=&amp;gt; true
irb(main):009:0&amp;gt; u.subscription.started_at = Date.parse('01-08-2016')
=&amp;gt; Mon, 01 Aug 2016
irb(main):010:0&amp;gt; u.save
=&amp;gt; true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach out to those members too and update my big file of notes about those members.  Next up we have a hanging subscription that&amp;rsquo;s not associated with any user and the date doesn&amp;rsquo;t match anything in Stripe and PayPal.   Looks like an accidental creation on the day I was retrospectively filling in data for the earliest few members.  I checked that it&amp;rsquo;s not associated with any members, even deleted ones, so I delete that subscription entity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):022:0&amp;gt; s = Subscription.find(20)
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Premium id: 20, type: "Premium", started_at: "2016-10-25 16:46:56", ended_at: nil, user_id: nil, plan_id: 2, sponsor_id: nil&amp;gt;
irb(main):023:0&amp;gt; User.with_deleted.all.count
=&amp;gt; 6704
irb(main):024:0&amp;gt; User.with_deleted.all.select{|u| u.subscription &amp;amp;&amp;amp; u.subscription.id == 20}
=&amp;gt; []
irb(main):025:0&amp;gt; s.destroy
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Premium id: 20, type: "Premium", started_at: "2016-10-25 16:46:56", ended_at: nil, user_id: nil, plan_id: 2, sponsor_id: nil&amp;gt;
irb(main):026:0&amp;gt; s = Subscription.find(20)
ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound: Couldn't find Subscription with 'id'=20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;rsquo;m managing to update about five records a day at the current rate &amp;hellip; hmmm&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Back To Premium Analysis</title>

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s feedback from the APSoc client, and clearly some more work to do on the LibreOffice Base application, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can delay a review of the AV Premium members.  I used to be doing weekly reach outs, but with the new pairing and mobbing sessions I&amp;rsquo;m several weeks behind.  I also need to generate the latest monthly report for the trustees.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been adding data on mobs/pairing/meetings as I have them so that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take so much time, but I also need to get the data in the WSO site accurate for Michael&amp;rsquo;s machine learning enterprise.  For that purpose we&amp;rsquo;ve created an API that allows us to get a list of the status of all the Premium users.  Using the great &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; library I can get nicely formatted json on the command line using a command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -H "Authorization: Token token=1234" https://www.agileventures.org/api/subscriptions.json | jq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that gives me data like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;email&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"sponsor_email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"started_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2017-03-06"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"ended_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"plan_name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Premium"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"payment_source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PaymentSource::PayPal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;email&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"sponsor_email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"started_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2017-03-09"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"ended_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"plan_name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Premium"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"payment_source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PaymentSource::Stripe"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what I need to do is go through ensuring this data is accurate and up to date.  First up I have an honorary member who hacked the PayPal endpoint in a security intrusion test.  This is not relevant data for the machine learning system.  The next is one who was sponsored, but now has a full time job and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been making use of the Premium Mob membership.  They&amp;rsquo;ve demurred paying their own way, saying they need time to get things organised.  I think I could sensibly mark these two as honorary members since they both contributed so much on the open source side.  I go ahead and create an honorary membership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb(main):003:0&amp;gt; Plan.create name: 'Honorary Premium'
=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Plan id: 12, name: "Honorary Premium", free_trial_length_days: nil, third_party_identifier: nil, amount: nil, created_at: "2017-12-18 09:58:46", updated_at: "2017-12-18 09:58:46", category: nil&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the first user to honorary, and that bumps them to the bottom of the list, so I can try and hook up the correct sponsor email to the second premium.  That was pretty easy, but now I also need to indicate the end of the sponsorship and that it&amp;rsquo;s passed on to another member.  I add an end to the sponsorship, but leave the &amp;ldquo;passing on&amp;rdquo; till I get to that sponsee.  I start making lists of who to check in with, who to send follow up forms to, and about which sponsee positions we need to fill.  Problem with this is that it seems to be taking me ages to crawl through making updates, considering whether to reach out to people, whether to follow up on inactive members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed the first five in the list and now we come up against a subscription with no associated user.  It was started on &amp;ldquo;2017-04-25&amp;rdquo;, so can I match that with someone in the Stripe interface, since that&amp;rsquo;s the payment type &amp;hellip; but none of the Stripe customers was created even close to that date (according to the stripe interface). Doh, no, ugh, it&amp;rsquo;s PayPal.  Where we do have a member who started at that time.  It looks like I also created a subscription for that user a few days afterwards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;email&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"sponsor_email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"started_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2017-04-29"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"ended_on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"plan_name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Premium Mob"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;"payment_source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PaymentSource::PayPal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensibly I hook that up correctly, and delete the inaccurate account, ah, but actually that&amp;rsquo;s the initial Premium that the member had for four days before upgrading to Premium Mob, so to hook that up we need to adjust the database model to support multiple subscriptions.  Hmm, looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll need to hit this every morning this week to get things sorted &amp;hellip; and maybe more &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="camera recording" src="/images/camera-recording.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I must be several weeks (months even?) and several layers of procrastination out from actually reviewing the AV ecosystem, since I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much using my blogging time to get focused work done on client projects and our main website project management.  It&amp;rsquo;s all still part of the AV ecosystem of course.  The client projects I&amp;rsquo;m working with are clients of AgileVentures, as is, naturally, the main website.  My days are full of mobs and f2f pairings, again all part of the AV ecosystem.  One day, one day, I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime the Anthony Powell Society client is apparently pretty happy with the screenshots of the forms for their membership database.  I did say we&amp;rsquo;d have an alpha version of their system ready for them today, but I&amp;rsquo;m reasonably confident I can make a few tweaks and get that done later today.   What I really haven&amp;rsquo;t got done yet is the help videos for the NHS wiki, which really needs to get done, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to switch to that in my blog time this morning.  I was trying to get it done last night, but quicktime kept crashing.  I did manage to get my computer re-booted, so let&amp;rsquo;s have another go and drive through them.  My plan is to make draft videos off the cuff (more or less) and then take the transcript and use it via auto-prompt to make them sound a bit more professional. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I, or the backdrop of my home office, look good enough at the moment (maybe after Xmas), so I&amp;rsquo;ll not do any in picture video of my talking head this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z21mZqNTPMQ"&gt;Search Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I went on to record another six of varying quality, but at least we have something done.  These can individually be re-recorded to improve them.  I&amp;rsquo;ve created a playlist for those:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuyBZ95Nkc4aqffFG436Xcn3HaJF7xRzO"&gt;Video Playlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also managed to get a last round of changes to the APSoc database and send them an alpha version before scrum, so I&amp;rsquo;m making some progress today.  Really need to get the reports sorted too &amp;hellip; back to the grindstone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review LibreOffice Locking Up</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lock" src="/images/lock.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the new forms on the PC seems to be leading to lots of LibreOffice locking up &amp;hellip;, and now in the process of trying to transfer it back to the Mac I seem to have lost two days worth of work, argh!  I had set the PC system on auto-save to every one minute &amp;hellip; something about using dropbox?  I can review all the past versions on dropbox, but none of them have the work from yesterday.  Somehow whatever I did yesterday didn&amp;rsquo;t get saved to dropbox.  Frustrating.  At least I still have the knowledge of how to get things done.  Practice run I guess.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the locking up and crashing is due to basic instability in the software or my overall approach of copy and paste.  I can&amp;rsquo;t bear re-creating items from scratch, particularly when I have to then re-set all the fonts individually.  Alright here we go again &amp;hellip; so new devops feature, create a cold backup at the end of each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m back on the mac where things are running a bit more smoothly - maybe developing out of dropbox was a bad idea.  Things running okay at the moment, allowing me to get a screen shot of the subscription payment screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/d5a6ja8jvokiut4/Screenshot%202017-12-14%2010.35.49.png?dl=0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to where I got in trouble on the PC.  Copying the subscription payment form to make the GiftAid and StandingOrder forms.  This time around I recreate the table element from scratch and it is pretty smooth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/b9epna64eh9ty85/Screenshot%202017-12-14%2011.25.05.png?dl=0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to standing order details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/63a2g5s1hgra9t2/Screenshot%202017-12-14%2010.48.44.png?dl=0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I think I might have done it and I now have mockups to show to the client &amp;hellip; no point tweaking them till we hear all that they want updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So despite pushing out fresh code all the dokku/azure bots still appear to be offline.  Would love to fix that, but yet I feel I should prioritize the client work.  I guess I can restart the dokku containers.   Has something in azure changed, blocking a new port?  Has rolling out metplus into dokku had some knock on impact?  Ah, I&amp;rsquo;m wrong; it looks like the main greeting bot did work overnight.  So I go back and post the welcome message manually to the few new slack folk.  Not sure about the greeter bots, but I&amp;rsquo;ve posted all the active project links in &lt;code&gt;#new\_members&lt;/code&gt; channel, so maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll see a few folks join channels and then we can tell if the project greeter bot is working again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I found the little widget that allows me to embed a spreadsheet view of another table in a LibreOffice Base form.  Now I need to be able to embed list boxes in it (which is relatively easy) and maybe have them point to other tables, which perhaps needs a sub-form in the table widget, hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background someone has answered my &lt;a href="https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/140501/base-dropdown-country-list/"&gt;question about countries in list boxes on ask libreoffice&lt;/a&gt; pointing to a countries table that comes with MySQL. Not sure if LibreOffice has MySQL installed, or that&amp;rsquo;s just a suggestion about where to get the data from, but they also point out that the SQL query needs to return the name of the country twice, so I try that, but the program locks up on me.  I think there&amp;rsquo;s something about list boxes in LibreOffice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t got quite down yet.  In the table widget I&amp;rsquo;ve got listboxes that are giving drop downs from the table data, but aren&amp;rsquo;t showing the relevant field itself &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a funny thing here - should I be trying to read the documentation about how to get it to work - I keep falling asleep whenever I try to read almost any documentation.  I generally make more progress just bashing on the interface and posting to help forums.  But perhaps I should just be getting mockups of the last two forms and sending them to the client, for what I will assume is reams of feedback that I could easily get distracted by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I force quit LibreOffice on the PC and re-start and adjust the query to return &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; twice, but that leads to no particular change to the countries list box.  I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll need to re-import the data, since the countries column got wiped out last time around.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the issue that the country names in the existing data don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily match the spelling/abbreviations in the list that I added.  Need to leave that for now; does the double name return help in the subscriptions payment form? &amp;hellip; it does, but needed to be combined with intelligence from another answer on &lt;a href="https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/65146/a-dropdown-list-inside-a-control-grid-table-with-sql-consult-in-base/?answer=65195#post-id-65195"&gt;ask libre office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe now I can bash out the other two forms &amp;hellip;?  Urgh, but it&amp;rsquo;s locking up on the PC again &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
