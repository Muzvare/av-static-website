&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was in a bit of pressure cooker yesterday with so many different tasks piling up.  I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to relieve the pressure slighlty by requesting that the start date of the edX MOOC get put back by a week.  UCBerkeley and edX seem just fine with that, and it&amp;rsquo;s done, and it brings the operation of the TA training course AV102 into line so that the TAs can help with the review of the course material.  This was the mistake that I made last year&amp;ndash;that the final assigninment in the main 4 week body of the AV102 course is pair programming and it&amp;rsquo;s in the following week that the learners start getting credit for contributing to supporting learners in the main MOOC and reviewing the course material.  I think part of the key problem, and probably the reason I made the SAME mistake this year (despite trying hard not too) is that my schedule spreadsheet didn&amp;rsquo;t include the fourth assignment and the first level 2 certificate items for the AV102, screwing up my estimates for when that course ends.  So I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed that now, and hopefully I can avoid the same mistake again, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many times we&amp;rsquo;ll be running this course again in this form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been nice to meet learners from the course coming into the AgileVentures hangouts this week.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had them participating in votes on the LocalSupport project, which is probably a good learning experience for them, but other LocalSupport contributors haven&amp;rsquo;t been around.  I think the voting on stories makes a lot more sense for people who are maintaining a certain level of involvement with the project, naturally; which turns me back to thinking that the bootcamp model has a lot going for it in that respect.  Not that I ever saw creating user stories or voting on them in any bootcamp I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with, but the opportunity is there.  I think the difficulty is that both for the individual learner and the project outcomes you need a certain base level of commitment; a certain number of hours a week that are going into the coding and project managment.  That&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to get from a group of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the recent regulars in LocalSupport don&amp;rsquo;t usually make the kick-offs, which have been quite well attended by Sigu, Cess and Stella, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t around yesterday for kick-off.  Admittedly it was the first time we moved it to Thursday.  Michael showed up and we talked about the direction of the overall project and the apparent low use of the system.  We spent 45 minutes chewing the fat, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much we achieved, apart from me bringing Michael up to date with how the project has pivoted from being a directory of organisations to focusing on listing volunteer opportunities.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it was a very productive discussion.  Maybe I should have been doing more listening.  I have trouble when I&amp;rsquo;m in the pressure cooker and I think people are telling me things I already know.  Then again, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s more important to allow someone to express what they want to say.  Michael was telling me I had to understand that lots of MOOC participants are just taking MOOCs to blast through 30 MOOCs in a year, just get a taste of things.  Totally.  Lots of people are just looking to get a taster of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in a particular subject area; and I do feel pleased that the AV folks can get to participate in scrums and vote on stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More the difficulty for me is that I&amp;rsquo;m behind on reviewing the PRs for LocalSupport and regular meetings with the client have gone out of the window with my overload on the NHS wiki project.  That could change in a week or two, but realistically I have to work on things that will pay for my time, as I&amp;rsquo;m out of spare cash.  I can see what I think would help the LocalSupport project thrive, i.e. active reviewing and integration of pull requests.  After meeting with Michael I did spend some time reviewing and see to my pleasure that Marouen had been reviewing and giving feedback on several.  That leaves Marouen&amp;rsquo;s Pull Request which needs a detailed review and planning; but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can devote time to that unless there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of funding for it.  I did manage to get Zmago&amp;rsquo;s new ReachSkills volunteer integration out, and we could have that onto production soon.  That&amp;rsquo;s the new vision for the site, that if the site were a one-stop shop for all the different sources of volunteering opportunities in Harrow then that might give people a reason to visit it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I think part of the problem is that the project hasn&amp;rsquo;t included us meeting and interacting with the intended end users.  At least in the NHS wiki project I&amp;rsquo;ve been out to talk and interact with lots of different stakeholders.  The LocalSupport client is in contact with lots of different charity groups in Harrow, but it feels like we&amp;rsquo;re just guessing about what the Harrow voluntary sector might actually want.  It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;ve spent nearly five years doing what design sprints are supposed to help us avoid, i.e. we keep building different versions of a full system, to discover that people aren&amp;rsquo;t so interested.  Not that we haven&amp;rsquo;t had lots of great learning experiences along the way for the client, for me, for the different folks in AgileVentures who are contributing.  That said maybe recently I&amp;rsquo;ve drunk too much design sprint Kool-Aid, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see the need for them everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the NHS wiki project we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any money or resources for development, but we&amp;rsquo;ve substituted off-the-shelf platforms, and we&amp;rsquo;re doing high level usability tweaking much faster and getting quick feedback through testing with stakeholders.  I think that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that we need to supercharge our AgileVenture projects.  Of course I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be turning myself from a hero to a host and not driving forward on these things.  The AV community has been coming up with their own ideas and have arranged a meeting for next Monday where I think it&amp;rsquo;s important I take a back seat and allow others to craft ideas, and then help empower them to try them out, fail and reflect and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh, well this blog went off in a different direction.  I was planning to focus on how most of yesterday morning was spent on configuring SSL certificates on Apache in our Bitnami/Azure setup and how I was just about to give up and then it started working after this incantation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;./letsencrypt-auto --apache --apache-server-root /opt/bitnami/apache2 --apache-challenge-location /opt/bitnami/apache2 --apache-handle-sites FALSE --apache-vhost-root /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami -d &amp;lt;domain-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I did also have to set up &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sites-available&lt;/code&gt; directories with symlinks like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ln -s /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf /opt/bitnami/apache2/sites-available/&amp;lt;domain-name&amp;gt;.conf
ln -s /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf /opt/bitnami/apache2/sites-enabled/&amp;lt;domain-name&amp;gt;.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also involved splitting the VirtualHosts files up, and then merging them back together after the SSL cert was installed, in order to get the redirect from http to https working properly.  That was pretty much the soft launch of https://wiki.healthylondon.org but there are so many other things to tidy up.  I may live to regret that we are hosting the wiki ourselves.  I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m back in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s managing &lt;code&gt;LocalSettings.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apache.conf&lt;/code&gt;, but it seemed the only way to get the thing set up on schedule.  Go with the flow!  I worry slightly that this will bite me when we need to renew the certificates as I&amp;rsquo;ll have to decompose the VirtualHosts file, but then again, maybe the auto certbot will be able to handle that then.  One thing at a time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least with the MOOC put back a week I feel like I have space to implement some delegation in AgileVentures, finish up this round of the NHS wiki project, and get the MOOC prep done.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got just a little breathing room &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it feels like my life is one of those dreams where you&amp;rsquo;re running as hard as you can, but you&amp;rsquo;re not moving forward.  Yesterday I fixed two sticky technical issues that have been bugging us for a while, I got out an updated video for the AV102 course and enjoyed an Elixir mob run by two of our Premium Mob members, but still didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;d made much of a dent in the old ToDo list.  Let me tell you about the first bug in our AgileVentures WebsiteOne Rails code.  Ideally I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be spending two hours tracking down and fixing that bug, as the impending release of the MOOC next week meant that the final week of the AV102 TA training course needed to go live sharpish.  However one of the videos in the final week was still talking about the Hangout plugins and they&amp;rsquo;ve been discontinued and there really needed to be an explanation of how to take AV events live manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the past couple of weeks on the odd day here and there we&amp;rsquo;d been getting 500 errors on the main events listing page.  It tended to come and go, and seemed more likely to occur on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Part of re-recording the video involved showing things appearing in the event list, and it seemed to me that not having the events index page working was a block on recording the video which should probably show that event list working.  That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the events list bug wasn&amp;rsquo;t also a priority fix, but I&amp;rsquo;m kind of drowning in high priority items at the moment.  Anyway, I resolved to have a good stab at getting the bug fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d previously hypothesized that the bug might be related to some third party website we were relying on for timezone conversions, based on some of the different error messages we were seeing in the logs associated with the 500 errors.  We were getting different errors in different parts of the code base, but they all seemed to be related to time conversion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.2.7.1/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/zones.rb:56:in `find_zone!'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.3.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.7.1/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:24:in `convert_time_to_time_zone'`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they were intermittent and changing started to make me think (as Michael had suggested) that this was a resource issue.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting any Google hits for these kinds of errors, so I tried upgrading our plan on Heroku, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t have much impact.   We&amp;rsquo;d just cloned the production data to staging and I saw we were getting similar errors there, but not on develop.  I was considering cloning to develop, when I ran locally against an older version of the production data - things were okay.  I cloned the production data locally and the events page was taking &amp;gt;20 seconds to load.  Whatever the issue was, something about the data was influencing the problem.  We have 20-second timeouts on Heroku, after which web queries are just shut down.  I speculated that some individual events might have corrupt timezones or something, but deleting a few had no impact on the time locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe I should do more to replicate the production setup locally, but I knew that was a pain, and I had basically the same issue locally, although without the error being thrown, since I have longer timeouts for http requests on my local machine.  The Rails logs on my local machine were showing that lots of time was being spent in the request, but actually the time spent constructing the view and doing activerecord queries were relatively small:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Completed 200 OK in 35596ms (Views: 359.4ms | ActiveRecord: 80.0ms)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely I could see that there appeared to be a 2 to 3 second wait after every query on the event instances table, which I traced into this method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;remove_past_events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;delete_if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;event_instances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:live?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with the query on the console I saw that as the number of &lt;code&gt;event_instances&lt;/code&gt; increased for an individual event, this method would get slower and slower. Some of the scrums had over 400 &lt;code&gt;event_instances&lt;/code&gt;, and the daily scrums appear multiple times in the list so we were repeating many slow operations.  I experimented with replacing &lt;code&gt;delete_if&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;reject&lt;/code&gt; but the method just got slower.  Then, looking more closely at the boolean statement I saw that the db query was in the first portion, and not the second, and actually the time check in the second half of the boolean would probably be false most of the time.  I tried switching the order of the boolean like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;remove_past_events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;delete_if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;event_instances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:live?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and suddenly the problem evaporated.  Now the majority of queries were not checking for event instances at all, and in relatively short order I had the fix deployed and the main site event lists page was loading in just a few seconds.  It&amp;rsquo;s still not as fast as I would like, but it got us out of the woods and unblocked me for re-recording the AV102 video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I was into an Elixir mob, and since two Premium Mobbers had taken the lead on running the session it was less intense effort from me and I&amp;rsquo;d been able to skip preparation the previous day.  We talked about starting a React Mob the following day and the question came up about whether Premium Mob membership covers attending more than one Mob per week.  My response that we&amp;rsquo;ve been somewhat flexible with that perhaps shows that I&amp;rsquo;m not really cut out for being a businessperson.  I just want everyone to have access to all materials :-(  It&amp;rsquo;s weird, because even with payment not every Premium Mob member shows up to the sessions they have in principle paid for.  There seems like a higher level of committment from the Premium Mobbers than overall in the rest of the community, but we have the conundrum that their activity is less visible as we&amp;rsquo;re running the Mobs in private events.  Gosh, just what is the model that will make this all work and be sustainable?  Having Premium Mob events show in our events stream, but only be accessible by those who&amp;rsquo;ve paid, with the stream of every fifth session being available for others to see what goes on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after lunch (and React Mob prep with Stephen Grider&amp;rsquo;s kindly donated React/Redux course) and besides the AV102 pivotal tracker voting sessions (which is another blog post), I was impaling myself on the set up for the Slack slash command for AsyncVoter on Azure/Dokku.  We&amp;rsquo;d spent multiple sessions struggling with this and kept hitting a 503 error with no extra information.  The system was all working fine on Digital Ocean with dokku (where Arreche had set it up), but even after getting SSL working on the Azure/Dokku system we were still stuck.  No one showed up for the AsyncVoter kick off, so I spent the half hour quietly deleting the previous app in Slack and creating a new one.  The whole setup is rather involved, and I think I got it fully documented at &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/asyncvoter-slack-command/wiki"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/asyncvoter-slack-command/wiki&lt;/a&gt; but I think ultimately the sticking point was how many layers you have to dig down to find the key URL for a slack app.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the first screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Slack App basic information" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2eveqtmb4waywis/Screenshot%202017-05-04%2010.13.48.png?dl=1" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now previously I&amp;rsquo;d worked out that we need to click on things like &amp;ldquo;interactive messages&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;OAuth &amp;amp; Permissions&amp;rdquo; etc. on the left nav bar.  I find it odd that there is configuration hidden behind those links, that look like to me like they would just be descriptions of the &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo;.  I usually expect configuration to be across the vertical nav, or to look more like buttons, but anyway, we&amp;rsquo;d previously ensured all the &amp;ldquo;interactive messages&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;OAuth &amp;amp; Permissions&amp;rdquo; URLs were updated to SSL, but there&amp;rsquo;s another.  Clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Building Apps for Slack&amp;rdquo;, reveals another control panel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="revealed control panel" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9zqr9ncli5umymu/Screenshot%202017-05-04%2010.17.07.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of this is with wording about doing things, not configuring them.  It was through the process of recreating the app from scratch that I discovered the other place that the URL needed to be updated.  Inside the slash command setting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="slash commands" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ay2gjyn4sfvuidg/Screenshot%202017-05-04%2010.18.36.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the option to edit, which reveals another URL that needed to be edited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="additional url edit" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qzbwmqxiprjz2wq/Screenshot%202017-05-04%2010.19.13.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you know it&amp;rsquo;s there, it&amp;rsquo;s not very discoverable.  Just writing this blog I see I can navigate to the top page via the &amp;ldquo;Slash Commands&amp;rdquo; on the left &amp;ldquo;Features&amp;rdquo; navigation links.  In our previous group sessions I think we&amp;rsquo;d been to that page repeatedly, but never realised that by editing the slash command we&amp;rsquo;d reveal another URL that needed updating.  I&amp;rsquo;d say the key usability issue here is that the summary of the slash command, before you edit, does not show that there are another three variables open for editing there, i.e. the RequestURL, ShortDescription and UsageHint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course now I know and I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about it, but there we go.  The next step is now to ensure we can set up subdomains so that we can have a staging instance and a production instance; I have an idea about how to do that, but it might take 5 minutes, or I might get stuck on it for two hours.  I have to say that, moment to moment, I do prefer coding and debugging to trying to record videos for courses, or even just setting up and organising courses.  Now it&amp;rsquo;s May 4th and soft launch for the NHS wiki and I&amp;rsquo;ve got to work out which of the list of fixes and changes to prioritise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL setup for Azure with bitnami mediawiki stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the Watchlist emails working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the full banner/logo in there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fighting for my attention are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the rest of the MOOC accessibility fixes done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting all the AV102 TA trainees access to the course as betatesters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and further follow up on WebsiteOne, LocalSupport, AsyncVoter; catching up with our sponsor drie etc. etc.  Like I say, the harder I try to run, the more it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m just staying in the same place :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got distracted by Slack and email again this morning.  Wanting to post my last podcast listen into #av&lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;talk I ended up replying to freerangers last post.  At least today I think I was calmer, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much to catch up with in all the incoming communication channels.  I&amp;rsquo;m definitely struggling with anxiety about getting everything done.  I&amp;rsquo;m less anxious this morning after completing the first round of wiki training with some of the HLP core team yesterday.  The big thing was that the MediaWiki visual editor ultimately loaded on three different NHS laptops and networks, and all the trainees succesfully created edited pages as well as got set up with moderation permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never managed to really complete important parts of the design sprint we started a month ago.  The project time and budget wasn&amp;rsquo;t ever going to allow for custom development of a particular solution, so we were reduced to a process of reflecting over the existing solutions.  We&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;sneaked&amp;rdquo; in the customer testing phase as part of training everyone in the use of the system.  We&amp;rsquo;ve also failed to &amp;ldquo;prototype&amp;rdquo; in the pure design sprint fashion by using a real software package (MediaWiki) and having that set up and working.  I think the design sprint concept assumes that there&amp;rsquo;s budget and time, following the sprint, to properly deliver the solution to the end users.  A critical part of the overall question for us was whether we could get &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reasonable solution working on the NHS laptops and networks, and the result from yesterday appears to be yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran an hour long training session and had the trainees try things out for themselves (as we might do in a usability test) before reviewing how things should be done (if they got stuck).  I learned a lot, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial sign up confirmation emails were going into some junk mail folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sign up process with the ConfirmAccount module was rather burdensome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the visual editor was working in our custom instance on NHS laptops/network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last element might seem trivial.  One might be tempted to say, well Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s visual editor worked fine on NHS laptops/network, so of course the same visual editor on our own server will work fine, but if working with computers has taught me anything it&amp;rsquo;s that you really musn&amp;rsquo;t assume that things work as you expect.  Particularly since we moved to MediaWiki after a selection of other high profile enterprise and open source wikis completely failed to load critical icons on the NHS laptops/network, which rendered them completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a series of additional training events to run next week, and in the meantime we&amp;rsquo;ve got a soft launch scheduled for tomorrow.  To support that we need to get a good subset of the following sorted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backups on our MediaWiki instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure we have a fixed IP -&amp;gt; okay because we are CNAMing to the bitnami name &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get SSL set up on our MediaWiki instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider whether we remove the ConfirmAccount plugin (is Moderation sufficient?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things we will need to do before next week include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting the watch list email notifications working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a training video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider whether to add Wikipedia style moderation templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could easily spend the whole rest of the week completely focused on this, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also got to re-record AV102 videos to reflect the changes to the Google Hangout API, and ensure we&amp;rsquo;ve made all the final accessibility changes on the MOOC which goes live next week.  There&amp;rsquo;s also reviewing all the pull requests for the different AgileVentures projects, and the process of following up with Premiums. I have finally started creating individual private Premium channels to try and distribute the load of supporting the increasing numbers of Premium members.  We can do it, yes we can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m getting to the blog phase late today.  I had a backlog of a couple of podcasts to tweet, but one of them seemed particularly relevant to the discussion going on in #av&lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;talk.  I&amp;rsquo;d been keeping myself away from the discussion in order to focus on preparation for the NHS Wiki project training and updating the online courses.  I thought I could get away with just posting the podcast into the AV community talk, but I ended up reading, and then replying to lots of little elements.  I was definitely being reactive, and reading on, it was clear that others were doing a good job of making many of the points I was making, so I probably didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve much more than blocking and overloading folks, which I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting better at not doing, oh well :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a promiment member of AgileVentures the danger is that my input ends up quashing debate (and problem-solving) rather than encouraging it.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.  There&amp;rsquo;s at least one member whose assertions always seem to get my goat, and I just can&amp;rsquo;t help getting into a debate.  On reflection I think I would have been better off reading the full discussion tomorrow and perhaps writing a blog post about it. At least with the new threaded reply system, maybe my input will not be as intrusive as it otherwise would. Either way, I&amp;rsquo;m now behind on my day&amp;rsquo;s schedule and have yet to write up what I did yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the May day bank holiday in the UK and I stayed off Slack and Hangouts and spent the full day getting all the moderation and visual editor components set up on the NHS wiki, ready for a training session with NHS staff later today.  It took a good two hours to get the visual editor system working, which involved setting up a node service called &amp;ldquo;Parsoid&amp;rdquo; and opening up an additional port in the Azure system we&amp;rsquo;re hosting on.  Ultimately the &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid/Troubleshooting"&gt;Parsoid troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; was really helpful, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting a stronger sense of the MediaWiki extension ecosystem, with some projects on GitHub and some not (MediaWiki has their own code review thing called Gerrit) and the wiki talk pages on individual extension pages seems to be the place to find out tips &amp;amp; tricks, and also the place to report bugs and receive help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day I had a 30 page keynote with step by step screen shots of the following for the wiki:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to go to access the wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to request an account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to search to find a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to edit a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to add a link to another wiki page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to upload an image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approving account requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receiving change notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approving changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejecting changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderation List&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banning repeat offenders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;d managed to tweak the wiki to change the name of the homepage, get references working and add a fair bit of additional content.  Basically ready for today&amp;rsquo;s hour long training session with a few core NHS HLP staff.  There are a set of other things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do, such as getting the whole thing on SSL (will that play well with VisualEditor/Parsoid?), installing Wikipedia moderation templates and replicating more of the HLP website look and feel.  MyWiki&amp;rsquo;s set up a VisualEditor enabled instance for us and said they&amp;rsquo;d look at getting the Moderation and ConfirmAccount extensions set up.  Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re ultimately going to be faster and easier, but if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t set up our own system I wounldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to work through and generate training documentation on the moderation process, so I think that&amp;rsquo;s time well spent :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I spent an hour updating the pair programming functionality in the AV102 and first part of the MOOC to switch back to our older optional style and start to work through some of the accessibility issues.  There&amp;rsquo;s still more to do, but that&amp;rsquo;s progress there.  The critical thing today is to record some new videos about the way that hangouts and events are working on AV.  Need to get that done before I head off for this training event.  More on that in tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blog :-)  Unless I get distracted by Slack &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two days have been blog driven NHS wiki flurries in the morning followed by mobbing and AgileVenturing in the afternoon.  In the Elixir mob on Wednesday we made further headway into Phoenix and I really start to question whether we&amp;rsquo;ve all been suffering through an instance variable nightmare.  Yesterday I caught up with the marketing team, the Ruby mob (where we got confident with some of our legacy code) and then spent an hour bashing away at AsyncVoter&amp;rsquo;s Azure/Dokku setup with Matt and Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are certain critical things that I need to do upfront this morning, i.e. as part of the blogging process, and some others that need to be done before lunch.  At the end of yesterday I was starting to feel calmer that we were bringing together all the things we needed for the NHS wiki project.  I&amp;rsquo;d emailed all the remaining stakeholders for additional meetings, the HLP team was getting the training dates set, I&amp;rsquo;d made an outline of the training materials, and we&amp;rsquo;d made contact with the Communications team.  Furthermore we&amp;rsquo;d also worked with the trustees to get the paperwork done for me to be paid this month, so that&amp;rsquo;s a relief.  The key things that need to happen before lunch today are then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process my payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to the HLP communication team (as main contact is off sick)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reply to NHS/Voluntary Sector stakeholder emails to confirm meetings for the week after next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to enterprise wellness related to moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that the first two have to be knocked off quickly. However in even trying to reach out to the HLP communications team I got lost in LinkedIn for 10 minutes reviewing the HLP organistaion there and connecting up to the NHS staff I&amp;rsquo;ve already met.  That was helpful, but (reality check) I&amp;rsquo;ve got to process this payment for my own personal finances.  It should be simple, but anything done for the first time can encounter issues, so let me just pause the blog to get that done &amp;hellip; done - had to do a text authorisation on my mobile, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken more than a minute in total.  I also see that the NHS payment for the first part of our work came through, so that&amp;rsquo;s a relief to have that all sorted.  I think my heart-rate has slowed slightly :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have to think about how best to communicate with the communications team &amp;hellip; an email to all the contacts, or a separate email to each one &amp;hellip;?  I demurred from emailing the three contact emails I had separately, and decided to email all three, cc-ing my existing contacts.  There&amp;rsquo;s a danger that asking a group of people that everyone assumes that someone else can deal with it.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a draft of the email I sent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sorry to email you out of the blue, but I'm working with NAME and NAME in HLP, and our charity AgileVentures is developing the new HLP Social Prescription wiki.

I met with NAME to discuss last week and everything is looking good.

This week I was following up with NAME about a URL subdomain for our wiki, but unfortunately NAME is off sick and I was wondering if you, or someone else on your team might be able to help us out. We're planning for a soft launch on May 4th and a hard launch on May 12th so we're on a bit of a short fuse.

One piece of feedback we've had from many stakeholders is that any new wiki system should not be a "new" location, so we were hoping to set up a subdomain under the http://healthylondon.org domain, e.g.

http://wiki.healthylondon.org

We assume that someone in your communications team, or some of your sub-contracted developers, will control the domain name records for healthylondon.org, and would be able to set up the "wiki" subdomain to point to our system.

Please let me know if any of you might be able to help with this, or if you could put us in touch with whichever controls the domain name.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did add delivery tracking and a return receipt.  Some might consider a return receipt a little aggressive, but there&amp;rsquo;s a time crunch here and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to quickly get to the person who can help us with this sub-domain, or discover that we can&amp;rsquo;t have a sub-domain ASAP.  So sending a group email with a &amp;ldquo;return receipt&amp;rdquo; request was my middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that done I should double check that the funds got transfered from before &amp;hellip; and it has. Yay! So while I&amp;rsquo;m in that bank interface I should update things for the new tax year &amp;hellip; and &amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s all done. Phew.  So that let&amp;rsquo;s me check a few more outstanding things off my todo lists.  So now I need to send out an email to Enterprise Wellness to find a good time for a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It pains me that blogs about what we did in the Elixir and Ruby mobs this week might be more interesting to the coders among this blogs readership, and to you I apologise, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got to feed my kids, and that&amp;rsquo;s what the NHS contract is enabling at the moment.  If you&amp;rsquo;re really, really keen to have more blogs about how Elixir is changing the programming world, and how Ruby gets confident, then vote with your wallet.  Sign up for AgileVentures Premium Mob membership (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already) and get your friends, family and neighbours to do so as well! :-)  In the meantime it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be more blogs about communication and mediawiki. Sorry &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the zone file propagated and we can now access our bitnami/azure instance at http://hlp-wiki.agileventures.org.  MyWikis support got back to me having fixed their VisualEditor which is now working for me on my Mac.  That means that MyWikis might actually be a good option for us.  I&amp;rsquo;m agonizing about whether I burn time on setting up SSL, VisualEditor and other things on our Bitnami/Azure system, against the other less technical things I need to do such as work out a training plan for the NHS staff, a communications/marketing strategy for the wiki release and a moderation plan.  I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve got to look carefully at the time that&amp;rsquo;s available over the next 10 days or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 2nd Tues 2:30pm - HLP Staff training (editing and moderating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 4th Thu - Soft Launch of wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 8th Mon - Meeting voluntary sector group to talk about wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 12th Fri - Hard Launch of wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MyWiki&amp;rsquo;s pricing seems pretty reasonable, and under the circumstances it seems like we should at least sign up for one of their solutions and pay $15 or $35 for the first month to see if we can get the feature set that we need.  Things that I need to fit into the schedule include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching out to 8 other stakeholders that the NHS has recommended I speak to (arrange for week of May 8th?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going back to earlier stakeholders who said they were interested to see what we&amp;rsquo;d created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating with Enterprise Wellness on the moderation (invite Mina to HLP staff training)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating with HLP communications on the URL and the launch of the wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the content in the wiki itself &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap that I&amp;rsquo;m really feeling at the moment is knowing whether we need a separate moderation package that the moderators will need extra instruction in, or if the basic elements of MediaWiki will be sufficient.  There appears to be a &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Moderation"&gt;moderation extension&lt;/a&gt;, but will it be more complex than we need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being distracted by Slack station-keeping for half an hour, I&amp;rsquo;ve texted the communications manager to see if she can make the training, and asked about getting wiki.healthylondon.org set up. I&amp;rsquo;ve emailed all the remaining stakeholders to ask what their availability is during the week of May 8th, and so I think the critical thing for me to work on now is a training script for Tuesday, and from that I can drive the sets of technical requirements we&amp;rsquo;ll need by each stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the training will need to consist of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to go to access the wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create (request?) an account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to search to find a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to edit a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to add a link to another wiki page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to upload an image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big decision is whether we require an approval process for people requesting accounts.  There does appear to be a &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmAccount"&gt;stable extension for confirming accounts&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve requested on Miraheze to see how it works.  For the purposes of the Tuesday training, simple creating of accounts is sufficient to have people practicing editing, but if the moderators are going to be approving requests for accounts, then we need that set up for them to see the process.  There&amp;rsquo;s also the moderation part of the training which will include at least some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approving account requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receiving change notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approving changes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverting inappropriate changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blocking/Banning repeat offenders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable MediaWiki training video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8irbbwNo2E that talks about the basics and setting up categories and talk pages, but making the above list makes it seem like a critical thing to check for is the email notification support.  I set &lt;code&gt;$wgUsersNotifiedOnAllChanges&lt;/code&gt; to an array with my email address on our Bitnami/Azure instance but didn&amp;rsquo;t yet receive an update.  I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll request the same from miraheze and maybe ask them how they did it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of little details to work out, both in technical and policy terms.  I really wish I could parallelize all this - I guess making lists is the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
