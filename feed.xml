    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of Tuesday was taken up with running a workshop on Agile Project Development for non-profits at the Volunteer Services Center up the road.  This was for Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative (VAHC), who are the client for the Harrow Community Network site, which uses the LocalSupport software.  Here was the description of the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach to project management, Agile Project Management, attempts to create a different model.
&amp;ldquo;Most nonprofits are interested in process improvements that will better enable them to accomplish their respective missions. However, major change can be intimidating and complicated to implement, especially if the organisation isn’t quite sure what it needs to do differently or lacks the expertise to make it happen across the organisation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agile project management approach aims to address the needs of those working in a project-focused environment who want to be agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will provide an insight into how you can effectively instigate agile project management into your nonprofit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training content:
 - What Agile is and where it came from
 - The Agile Manifesto, principles and practises
 - The value of Agile to your nonprofit
 - Implementing Agile in your nonprofit
 - Communication, collaboration and culture
 - Risk management and pitfalls
 - Technologies to help
 - Further resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will leave the course having gone through a small scale agile process learning first hand how it can be implemented into your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trainer: Agile Ventures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost (Per Person):
  - Free - Harrow Voluntary, Community &amp;amp; Social Enterprise Sector
  - £30 - Voluntary, Community &amp;amp; Social Enterprise Sector (Not working or based in Harrow)
  - £40 - Public &amp;amp; Private Sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were eight attendees from different charity groups based in Harrow and some of the adjoining boroughs.  Including Alex and myself that made 10 which worked pretty well I think.  We&amp;rsquo;d done a &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2016/11/21/agile-workshop/"&gt;dry run of the event&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks back with the VAHC staff in a group of six including myself.  That dry run had followed this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro &amp;ldquo;What is Agile? How this workshop will run&amp;rdquo; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;kickoff&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; generate a series of stories about what to do in the workshop, e.g. &amp;ldquo;How do we motivate people?  What&amp;rsquo;s a scrum?&amp;rdquo; write on cards, arrange on whiteboard &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;voting&amp;rdquo; on stories &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; identify common stories and vote on their difficulty, work out their priority &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go into small teams each working on a different story &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small teams each presenting their work on their story &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;retrospective&amp;rdquo; looking back over the process and how it could be improved &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excluding breaks being 6 ten minute chunks.  The full workshop followed the same model but each section lasted 25 minutes.  The key things I&amp;rsquo;d learned from the dry run was &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to bring a mac VGA connector to use the projector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sprint diagram would be helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might need a way to intro people&amp;rsquo;s names &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be good to arrange all the tickets onto a kanban board on the wall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d need better pens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Agile process to understand the Agile process might be confusing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the simple logistical issues sorted, and started the main workshop by having the eight attendees do pairwise introductions.  I started the workshop as before by explaining the six part structure of the workshop and added the new element of stating the workshop objective &amp;ldquo;To understand Agile Project Management&amp;rdquo;.  I tried to highlight how ultimately the Agile processs could be applied to any project, but that our project in the three hour workshop was to &amp;ldquo;To understand Agile Project Management&amp;rdquo; and we would be compressing what might be done in an 2 week sprint into those three hours.  I talked briefly about the background of Agile, and how it derives from the &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Software Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around I showed an image to represent a sprint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scrum overiew" src="http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/methods/scrum/scrum-overview.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then we got into the process of starting to generate stories.  This time around I didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute any stories myself but with 9 others writing away we quickly had loads to work with.  I lead the process of trying to organise the stories into themes.  The stories were pretty much all questions.  I guess in a future workshop I could ask for all the stories to be in the stakeholder, objective, desire format, but things seemed to go okay without it.  We went through a process of consolidation and generated five &amp;ldquo;epics&amp;rdquo;, which we voted ongiving us the following set of ready items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile affect funding and reporting to funders? (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile handle financial planning and management (3 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile handle conflict (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile planning cope with changing timeframes (1 point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the Pros &amp;amp; Cons of Agile vs other methodologies (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which we prioritised and then worked on the first three in three teams of three, with me moving between the teams to give help and support.  The really interesting things to come out of the process was to see the attendees answering their own questions and inferring from the overall Agile process that we were using how Agile might work for them.  As usual the voting and voting discussion was a critical learning period as we distinguished what we were voting on (complexity/ambiguity rather than priority or delegation), and I think the attendees were getting insights into how just having that discussion could help surface and resolve conflicts.  While the teams were working I got their tickets up on a makeshift Kanban layout on the wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tp01dj0jtxdwvfy/non-proft-kanban.jpg?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams presented their findings to each other and I saw the time had run away with us.  There was only five minutes left for the retrospective.  This was a shame since as I was at pains to point out, all the other mechanics of scrums, sprints, standups, kanban charts etc. were all optional variables, and the key element that made a process Agile was reflection on how different aspects of the process were working.  We did quick retro going round the tablewith each person saying briefly what had been positive and could be improved on about the workshop.  Not ideal since those going first would bias those talking after, but the general theme was that the attendees had found actually working through the Agile process very informative, but that many of them would like more specific examples about usage of the techniques in the non-profit sector.  There was also interest in a more advanced workshop and I mentioned Alex and my idea about a 2 day workshop, with the 2 days being separated by 2 weeks, and effectively running an inception/kick-off and retrospective for an organisation.  It would certainly be interesting to run something like that although Alex was skeptical about people coming back for the second day 2 weeks later.  I think if people were paying for it that might make all the difference :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great experience, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be very interested to hear what people say in the privacy of the feedback forms.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;d want to spend every day doing workshops like this, but it was great to be meeting all these hard-working charity/non-profit folks, and what I&amp;rsquo;d really love to be doing it more implementation of Agile methods in their organisations to see if we could really help them improve their outcomes.  Perhaps this will be a stepping stone to that &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hosting Slack Bots</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The slackbot had stayed live for most of the weekend on drie push, but on Monday morning it was unresponsive, and although we&amp;rsquo;d completed a vote or two, not all the notifications had come through.  The bot would not restart from fresh pushes of code.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it back online without ssh-ing in and starting it directly.  drie push is not explicitly designed for hosting slack bots, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any functionality to put the bot into a background job that would persist after logging out of ssh.  Actually I&amp;rsquo;d been surprised that the slack bot had worked on drie push at all; I&amp;rsquo;d pushed it up there as an experiment and seen that it worked partially, but now we needed a more consistent hosting solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;d shown the #websiteone channel the promise of a bot that could run an asynchronous vote, there was less appetite for starting manual ones, and not having the stable hosted bot was starting to feel like a blocker.  Slack has a &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/hosting"&gt;page dedicated to different bot hosting solutions&lt;/a&gt;. In parallel with chatting on Slack with the team about the options, I spent a little while looking at what AWS Lambda had to offer, and then Matt suggested that BeepBoop looked like it had a great free offering.  I signed up for a BeepBoop account and got through most of pulling our repo asyncbot directly into beepboop, but then it was failing due to lack of a DockerFile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;unable to prepare context: Cannot locate Dockerfile: absDockerfile: "/tmp/b54c5a30aa584533b027af837beeef64683410820/repo/Dockerfile"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was probably a simple solution, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure.  I felt like I could have this bot up and running on AWS pretty quickly and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be beholden to some other service that was going to start squeezing me on price like Heroku has been doing recently.  The only reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t immediately spun up an AWS instance was that whenever I tried to go to the AWS console in Chrome it was auto-switching to the saasbook team account, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create some instance that Armando would start paying for.  I went to Safari (I know there are chrome profiles) and created a new AgileVentures AWS account and created a free-tier eligible tiny Ubuntu instance and had that up in a matter of minutes.  In the meantime Arreche was telling me he could get the planning poker script up in hubot pretty fast, but I really wanted to see how far I could get with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up the ssh config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# ~/.ssh/config

Host AsyncVoterBot
HostName ec2-54-999-999-999.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
User ubuntu
IdentityFile "~/.ssh/SuperSecretKey.pem"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to make it super easy to log into the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ssh AsyncVoterBot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I installed git, nodejs and npm using &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; (although I burned some time mistakenly installing &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and then trying to build node from source) before cloning our async slack bot project, setting the slack bot token in the environment and running the bot in a tmux session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tmux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# in tmux environment
$ nodejs server.js &amp;amp;
# Ctrl-B D to detach
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tmux attach # to get back in
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was imagining I would have to do some security configuration to get it all to work, but no such thing.  The bot was live, and I ran some test votes in a private channel.  I had the tmux session (just as we have on the autograders) so that the bot can stay live and running even after I log out of the machine, and I checked that the bot stayed live over a few ins and outs.  It&amp;rsquo;s still running today, and although my attempts to ssh into it appear to be &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#TroubleshootingInstancesConnectionTimeout"&gt;timing out&lt;/a&gt;, I assume that&amp;rsquo;s a temporary AWS issue (fixed with adding an inbound rule for my new IP).  There&amp;rsquo;s no cost for the bot so far, but that will be the real question, how much does this cost us?  I was able to link the new AgileVentures AWS account to the new AgileVentures bank account.  I sort of assume that this will come in less than the $7 a month that Heroku want for an always-on instance, but let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is the right overall approach, but I was pleased to get something up on AWS that has a chance of being an affordable solution, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident in my ability to manage AWS boxes given my experience with the autograders.  We managed two or three bot scaffolded votes on #websiteone and there were others to do in parallel in #async_voter so I did a manual one there which pushes us towards new features like supporting multiple votes in parallel, and getting a test harness round this hacky botkit code.  More voting and coding to be done!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friday was full of meetings.  I started off heading down to the &lt;a href="https://www.harrowcn.org.uk/organisations/carramea-community-resource"&gt;Carramea Community Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Consortium of Anti-Racist Refugee and Minority-Ethnic Associations). Carramea has been operating in South Harrow for over 12 years, and provides affordable office solutions for small charities and voluntary groups; as well as IT and Language classes.  I&amp;rsquo;d met the head honcho Tony O&amp;#39;Hara at local WoodCraft and other charity events, and that morning Rachel from Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative was running a training session to show some of the staff how to work with Harrow Community Network (HCN), Do-It and SurveyMonkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there to observe and took notes as Rachel guided three staff through the mechanisms to update directory information in HCN, and to post volunteer opportunities.  Tony dropped in and out as he covered the reception desk while the training session was underway.  Rachel then went on to show how to post opportunities on Do-It and give pro-tips.  Carramea already had an opportunity up on Do-It (for volunteer receptionists) and it was already showing in our system, having been pulled in automatically from the Do-It database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Carramea volunteer opportunity on HCN" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aa2o2g87b23z98p/Screenshot%202016-11-28%2009.42.00.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have been projecting, but it seemed clear that there was not much incentive for the Carramea staff to add volunteer opportunities directly through our interface unless it would also post them to Do-It.  And even then, it would probably take a superlative user experience, and posting to other sites such as TeamLondon and ReachSkills in order for it to be worth their while.  This sort of system does seem to be Rachel&amp;rsquo;s vision for Harrow Community Network going forward.  No one wants to be entering the same information over and over, and if we can create a seamless experience that allows posting to multiple volunteer sites we really might start to see usage of the HCN site go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rachel went on to train the staff on SurveyMonkey one of the main things that seemed to be causing a drag was password management, and at the end when asked, I suggested that perhaps 1password or LastPass might be something that the Carramea might like to try internally.   It had been great to see a local charity being shown the HCN site.  As a training session we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see usability problems that might come up when the staff use it independently, but that pushes me to get better at monitoring and interpreting the site usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I dashed back to my home office to get the days blog up, try out a new process of editing blogs directly on GitHub and do pull requests from a branch to auto notify the #blog_drafts channel, then lunch and a Premium Plus pairing on P vs NP and classic problems like Travelling Salesman, Knapsack and 3-SAT.  I must dig out the paper I wrote on 3-Sat &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much chance to reflect though, I was immediately off to another local charity event.  Rachel had suggested I come along to the Youth First event, an initiative being funded by Harrow Council through the &lt;a href="https://youngharrowfoundation.org"&gt;Young Harrow Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to center around creating a platform for Youth services, resources and opportunities in Harrow.  In particular an app which young people could use on their phones to find out about activities and resources local to them in the hope that this would help those who might otherwise fall in with gangs or fall out of the system due to challenges such as mental health problems.  I got there early and did a quick on-location &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck Scrum&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event itself there were moving speeches by a former gang member, and another youth who&amp;rsquo;d faced mental health challenges, about the paths they&amp;rsquo;d ended up taking and how they&amp;rsquo;d turned things around.  There was enthusiastic applause for both, and I was particularly struck by the former gang member who&amp;rsquo;d turned to crime to get money to pay for things like going to football training.  I&amp;rsquo;m coach of an under eight soccer team, and it makes me think about ways in which we can make things more affordable for disadvantaged youths and their families.  I also met Lynne who works with former gang members and told me there are free football sessions being run in Harrow, so there&amp;rsquo;s definitely room for connecting young people with the resources available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was concern voiced at the event about the longevity of the project.  Apparently a well-intentioned website had previously tried to do something similar in the past, but had fallen by the wayside.  We heard that the council had already selected an IT firm to deliver on the project for the next five years, but I worry that this will go the way of similar large projects where the feedback from the community and end-users do not reach the developers.  Or does not reach them quickly enough to have an impact.  Clearly disadvantaged youths are not going to always have cellphones, but care-worker and other support folks will, and in round table discussions we talked about how just having that information to hand could be very useful.  At the same time it&amp;rsquo;s another dangerous &amp;ldquo;technology to the rescue&amp;rdquo; setup.  Another member of the round table pointed out that even with the information about what&amp;rsquo;s available locally there&amp;rsquo;s actually getting individuals to the take the step towards attending events, and reaching out for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly it occurred to me on the way home that part of the challenge is the increasing population in Harrow, with many single family occupancy houses being turned into bedsits for 5 or 6, and the building of low-rise flats in almost every available free space.  Harrow might seem to be a privileged borough in North West London, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without its problems.  The Youth Offer event was taking place the day after a &lt;a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/student-stabbed-outside-south-harrow-tube-station-loses-fight-for-life-a3403541.html"&gt;19 year old died&lt;/a&gt; from an apparently unprovoked knife attack outside South Harrow tube station, just down the road from the Carremea offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a packed day, but great to see the connection between our work and members of the community.  The difficulty with being charity and non-profit focused is that money is scarce, and everything&amp;rsquo;s being run on a shoestring.  And let&amp;rsquo;s not fool ourselves that we&amp;rsquo;ll have a positive impact by throwing technology at the problem; let&amp;rsquo;s keep everything on the table and try to have an impact first and foremost and worry about which tools and technology we use second.  That said these are projects that you can really put your heart and soul into, because they are fighting to make a positive difference in people&amp;rsquo;s lives, not just fighting to make a buck.  If you believe there&amp;rsquo;s more to life than money then come join us and put your heart and soul into projects that can make a difference worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We ran our first AV Premium Mob Programming session looking at code from the book &amp;ldquo;Confident Ruby&amp;rdquo; by Avdi Grimm.  We created a Cloud9 workspace and gave everyone access to the enviroment.   We had four Premium members join the hangout, and I introduced some of the concepts from &amp;ldquo;Confident Ruby&amp;rdquo; before playing with some of the code samples.  All the members in the hangout had read and write access to the Cloud9 workspace, but on this first occasion I did most of the typing.  Most of the members had Avdi&amp;rsquo;s book or had been listening to the Ruby Book Club podcasts that cover it, but it was the first time mob programming for all of them, and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll get them doing more typing in future sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Avdi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Use built-in conversion protocols&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Collecting Input&lt;/em&gt; pattern with chats about the use of Structs in Ruby, monkey patching (duck punching), duck typing and whether the implicit and explicit conversion operators (e.g. &lt;code&gt;to_int&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;to_i&lt;/code&gt;) should be more actively documented in the Ruby core classes.  I also touched on the concept of &amp;ldquo;Power Level&amp;rdquo; in response to the question of when to use Structs vs using Classes.  In my experience Structs are an often over-looked aspect of Ruby that allow a developer to create a data structure that has less power than a full blown class.  In parallel with the security guideline that you should only ever provide the minimum level of access necessary to get a job done, there&amp;rsquo;s a similar argument to say that you should only ever use the minimally flexible data structure or entity in order to acheive a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility sounds great, but it actually equates with complexity.  More powerful entities can do more things, and they are more complex to interact with as a result.  I often write out a simplified power sequence for Ruby as follows from low power to high power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boolean ( true/false )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;struct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive over simplification as the functionality of each of these entities varies along many different dimensions.  However in general we should prefer to use, say, a boolean (true/false) to represent something that has two possible values (e.g. receive email updates preference), rather than using a String to store the values &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo;.  The Struct in Avdi&amp;rsquo;s example looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:prize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"first"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Peasant's Quest game"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"second"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Limozeen Album"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;third&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"third"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Butter-da"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although he could have used hashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"first"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Peasant's Quest game"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"second"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Limozeen Album"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;third&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"third"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Butter-da"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hash is more flexible. We can add arbitrary additional key/value pairs to the individual hash objects, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That flexibility is extra power, that maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t need at this stage.  You can argue we might need it later, but the hashes are also rather unDRY in that the key names have to be repeated over and over, and if we need an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; key we can add it to the Struct, which is arguably DRYer than the long form hashes.  The Struct also provides us a nicer syntax for accessing its key/value contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to both approaches.  DRYing out the keys into the Struct means that we have increased the dependency between the three entities, so that if we add an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; to the Struct, all the instances of the Struct will also sprout an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; key.  Maybe we want that and maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t; it all depends on the domain model and the behaviours we are trying to support.  Ruby Structs and Hashes differ in various ways, and the real challenge when choosing one over the other is getting the right match, from the various features of Struct and Hash, to the problem we are trying to solve.  It&amp;rsquo;s also sensible to avoid agonising and choose whatever seems simplest to start with and then change to more powerful or complex entities as the required behaviour starts to generate pain points in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback from the mob session was positive, and we had great suggestions for more group problem solving in the future to get everyone&amp;rsquo;s fingers dirty with the code.  It was a good day, and after lunch I started knocking off the automation tasks identified from the previous couple of days profiling.  I started by pushing the slack bot code onto &lt;code&gt;drie push&lt;/code&gt; where remarkably the bot stayed live, and so I ran some votes.  Michael joined me in a hangout as I updated the static website so that blog images would have a max-width of 700px (to save me re-sizing), and then worked on WebSiteOne to have members&amp;rsquo; titles update when they upgrade to Premium.  That was a nice set of three things to automate small tasks that are leaching away at my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I hope to keep iterating on automating away simple tasks so I can have more time for interacting with Premium members in Mob, F2F and Plus programming sessions!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Profiling of My Days</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I did a second day of profiling.  The details are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;09:15 - 10:15 writing blog draft (plus distribution)

10:30 - 11:00 reviewing slack and email - promoting mentors and premiums

11:00 - 11:30 Writing emails to potential sponsors

11:30 - 11:45 Scrum

11:45 - 12:30 WSO hangout with Premium F2F member

12:30 - 12:45 Negotiating with company on potential paid project

12:45 - 13:00 Getting CraftAcademy and PayPal folks into new premium chat instance - notifying Premium Mobs, F2Fs and Pluses about mob programming session

14:15 - 15:15 Fielding questions from Premiums on Slack (got an upgrade to F2F), co-founder 

15:15 - 15:45 PR Review (AsyncVoter, LocalSupport)

15:45 - 16:00 Scrum

16:00 - 17:00 More PRs - fixed AsyncVoter - SHF comments, did AV mailing, updated and posted blog 

18:15 - 18:45 Reviewing ProjectScope PRs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing this again with Eliminate, Simplify, Automate, Delegate (ESAD) an early insight was that I could automate the creation of the list or related videos that I drop into the end of each blog.  A tiny saving, but maybe worth it.  Reviewing other elements in turn: Slack and Email - I feel like I really have to do that each day to stay in touch with sponsors, premiums and mentors.  Promoting a new Premium member and a new Premium Mentor involved some manual work on the database, so I created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1300"&gt;ticket on WSO&lt;/a&gt; to cover the details of what might be automated there.  That looks promising. There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of relatively straightforward coding tasks there, although there is also my desire to refactor the charges controller &amp;hellip; my intuition is that there&amp;rsquo;s a double win for that sort of automation when we do it in a live pairing session.  I think it can help when others see into our codebase, and can serve as a potential learning platform.   Not that thousands of people will ever pour over our videos, but it&amp;rsquo;s a chance for me to pair with other AV members and I think we all get value from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to step up writing of emails to potential sponsors after Charles Max Wood of Ruby Rogues talked on the Freelancers show about how that was the critical task that could have the biggest impact that he often didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to.  Don&amp;rsquo;t think I can drop or delegate that yet.  After the scrum I got in a hangout with Matt to unblock him on WebSiteOne.  I burned some time explaining why I don&amp;rsquo;t like the UX of our status feature on WSO.  Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s wasting time, or maybe that&amp;rsquo;s important communication of my values regarding UX design to other team members?  I feel like at least some value was being derived both for WSO and for Matt as we unblocked him and cleared up ambiguity around the latest ticket he was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I was negotiating in Slack with a company about a potential paid project.  Maybe that will come to nothing, but my intuition (which I think Michael and Marouen share) is that a few paid projects would make the whole Premium package so much more attractive to those on the fence about whether to sign up.  Then it was more Slack action getting the CA and Paypal Premiums into the new Premium chat instance.  I&amp;rsquo;d used the Stripe &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; list to invite folks, so that had left out those who had not signed up directly through Stripe.  That pushes me to want to improve the domain model in WSO so we can properly represent all the current avenues members use to go Premium, so that I have a clear central place for a coherent list, although thinking about it I can see how I can extract that data from the console &amp;hellip;  Still as the number of Premium users increases (which is a key goal) we&amp;rsquo;ve got to get better at consistently tracking who they are and how they&amp;rsquo;ve come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time notifying Premium Extras (a new term - that&amp;rsquo;s Mob, F2F and Pluses, i.e. everyone eligible for Mob) about the Mob Programming session we&amp;rsquo;ll do later today.  Mob programming sessions feel like they could be an important engine of growth.  After lunch Michael wasn&amp;rsquo;t around again and I dithered about throwing myself into programming tasks versus just catching up on admin and station keeping.  I was fielding questions on Slack for almost an hour.  I could argue that I should have been productively coding with that hour, however one Premium member did upgrade to F2F following our conversation.  I think that&amp;rsquo;s something critical there.  Communicating with those consuming the services you provide is essential.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean doing tech support for everyone on every tier all the time.  However, giving an ear to those who are already committed to support our charity financially and helping them find ways to derive more value &amp;hellip; that feels kind of core.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess ultimately I need some full time programmers, some full time marketing people, some full time &amp;ldquo;sales&amp;rdquo; people &amp;hellip; :-) Well I hope we can stay small and friendly for some time to come.  After that Slack binge I did get down to some PR review, getting two PRs merged into AsyncVoter and a flurry of comments on LocalSupport PRs.  We had another quick scrum and there was more admin, doing the AV mailing - 7 more 15 minute stabs at that and I&amp;rsquo;ll have emailed everyone in the community and then perhaps I can take a bigger picture look about how we stay in touch people in the long term.  Or am I setting an artificial barrier for myself there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten to update and post my blog of the previous day, so I hit that and then grabbed some time later in the evening to review ProjectScope PRs for the Berkeley students.  Armando feels the ProjectScope project metric tracking system is going to be critical to managing his course in the future and the part 3 project course for the MOOC.  I was able to give a flurry of comments and agonise about whether I was pushing on the students too hard.  I need to spend some time deploying their branches and experimenting with real project data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the bot shut down when I closed my computer so we may have lost attempted 3rd votes to the async vote we were trying to run in WSO.  Gotta get that bot deployed permanently.  So anyhow, what could I eliminate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posts on PRs that are too long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrums running over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;me ranting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow AV mailings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what could I simplify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what could I automate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog draft submission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog draft video lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AV mailing process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium and Mentor upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking of current range of Premiums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting of async bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what, if anything, I can delegate. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s a volunteer in our organisation, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can ask anyone to do anything.  I need to wait for people to ask for interesting things to do.  The most successful thing so far has been a process of making tickets of everything I can think of as important on the relevant repos and occasionally pointing to things when people ask :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think that&amp;rsquo;s enough profiling for now.  There&amp;rsquo;s some clear possibilities for automations, and I guess rather than agonise about which to do I should just start knocking them off in some order :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I profiled my day yesterday in an attempt to apply the Eliminate, Simplify, Automate, Delegate (ESAD) mantra and create space for the important things :-)  Here&amp;rsquo;s my rough profile of the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;09:00 - 10:00 writing blog (5mins on getting that up and in slack #blog_drafts)

10:15 - 10:40 reviewing slack and email - starting a WSO vote

10:40 - 11:00 reviewing previous days blog and pushing out

11:00 - 11:30 rebuilding slack client after creation and renaming of teams

11:30 - 12:15 scrum and debugging with Premium Mob Member

12:30 - 13:30 edX emailing, AV emailing, Social Media update, negotiating with company about a paid project, editing and promoting blog for Kenyan Bootcamp code9ty

14:45 - 15:00 rebooking physic appt

15:00 - 15:45 reviewing asyncvoterUI and LS PRs (starting hangout 2nd time adding my AV banner)

15:45 - 16:15 scrum - catch up with co-founder Thomas, voting with Rose and student

16:15 - 17:00 meeting with heroku about our charges

17:00 - 17:30 chatting with sponsor drie about hosting services
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s apply the ESAD criteria to each in turn.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know that there&amp;rsquo;s anyway to simplify the process of actually writing the blog.  I could make them shorter, or even eliminate them, perhaps doing them less frequently.  I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to do that as I find them a nice grounding start to the day, the prevents me from just sitting down and reacting to whichever seems the most urgent message on Slack or in email.  Intuitively the feedback I&amp;rsquo;m getting on the blogs is that they are often too long, have too much code, not enough images, but also that they&amp;rsquo;ve helped others understand my perspectives and what we are trying to achieve with AgileVentures.  I can&amp;rsquo;t really delegate them (although I&amp;rsquo;d love to have more in the community blogging), and the only place for automating them would be to work on the final portion of pushing them to GitHub and Slack where each day I have to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy from TextEdit to Sublime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save in correct location and format for middleman blog (e.g. 2016-11-03-pithy-title.html.markdown)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add middleman blog header, edit date there, edit title and edit keywords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to my av-static-website terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git commit -am &amp;#39;new blog&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a browser in the blogs directory of the av-static-website: i.e. https://github.com/AgileVentures/av-static-website/tree/master/source/blog_articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the link for the days blog and copy it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to slack and paste to the #blog_drafts channel with &lt;code&gt;@channel new blog draft &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this only takes a minute or two, but I am doing it every day, and having written it out I think several parts could be automated or simplified.  It might take 30-60 minutes to get automated in the way I want, so I&amp;rsquo;d need to feel sure that I was going to write another 15-30 blogs before I&amp;rsquo;d start to see time savings.  Possibly I could write a bash script &amp;hellip; there are also things that can go wrong if I have to deal with merge conflicts (I should always &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; first).  I could just blog on medium and be done with it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided that partly because I want to share drafts with anyone who joins #blog_drafts and have them able to submit PRs, although perhaps a better solution is to just make everyone interested a members of the AgileVentures organisation on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to think about whether there are some existing automations, like setting up pure PR notifications on the #blog_drafts channel, and submitting my blog as a PR from a branch.  That might seem like crazy extra work, but it connects to something else I&amp;rsquo;d like to automate further; the process of submitting a PR from the command line, which seems to involve me re-typing the same thing several times over, e.g. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b #waffle_id_exciting_feature_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doing and committing the work (commit message often includes &amp;lsquo;exciting feature name&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hub pull-request -b develop&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;editing the PR description in vim to include the text &lt;code&gt;fixes #waffle_id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking here that if I could get something like a default commit message based on the branch name, then I could avoid typing the waffle_id and feature name twice.  In the blog case there are no waffle ticket ids to link up, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;m looking at being able to type something like the following from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ blog_draft &amp;lt;blog title&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which would do the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;code&gt;git checkout -b new_blog&amp;lt;blog_title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;code&gt;git add source/blog_articles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c) &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;#39;new blog on &amp;lt;blog title&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
d) &lt;code&gt;hub pull-request -b develop&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and with the right notifications a bash script doing the above could ping the #blog&lt;em&gt;drafts channel.  With a Ruby script I could probably get finer tweaks so that it actually sent  &lt;code&gt;@channel new blog draft &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to #blog&lt;/em&gt;drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I could clearly do the above analysis on all the sections of the day.  Blog getting too long?  Quick review.  Daily review of Slack and Email?  Can&amp;rsquo;t really avoid, just have to avoid getting sucked in to low priority things.  I try to pull each question or request into my action plan document and order and then take passes through my action plan to work out what order to do things in.  The asynchronous voting is already the subject of ongoing automation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the previous days blog and pushing that out requires some more automatable steps e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) merge any PRs&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c) read through and make minor corrections (10mins?)&lt;br&gt;
d) &lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
e) &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;#39;tweaks&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
f) &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
g) &lt;code&gt;rake publish&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

i) adjusting image sizes, making sure blog looks okay  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with both the initial blog generation and publishing the previous days draft is that the bulk of the time is not automatable without a serious AI.  I guess the question is whether the surrounding command line cruft is worth automating.  Even if it&amp;rsquo;s not, it could be fun, and possibly beneficial if the automation can make PRs from the command line slightly less work &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slack rebuild was (hopefully) a one off.  The scrums - I do two a day, and they are capped at 15 mins, but I often end up doing another 15 mins after the scrum - today the first scrum was followed by 15 mins debugging with a Premium Mob member, which was fun and (I think) worth it.  The second scrum 15 min follow on was a catch up with my Co-Founder so pretty important &amp;hellip;  Although scrums can certainly serve to break up flow on a longer more complex piece of work; it&amp;rsquo;s also critical to coordinate with the team, and these Scrums are our welcome mat and showcase.  I am still conflicted about whether they are worth the effort to maintain.  Google Hangouts on Air and our plugin seem stable-ish again after our outage of a couple of weeks back, although I am needing to re-start hangouts occasionally, and the fact that my lower third banner is not saved means I&amp;rsquo;m re-adding that for every scrum and hangout - which burns 30 seconds every time, although it&amp;rsquo;s helped me memorise the AV colour code (#ee7335).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m unclear if the &lt;a href="https://www.hangouttoolbox.com/"&gt;google hangout toolbox&lt;/a&gt; is still being maintained.  I just posted the following to their G+ support group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower third still works for me, but I can&amp;rsquo;t save it - I have to re-enter the details every time.  Is the code for this open source?  Is there someone actively maintaining it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some more details - I can set up my lower third like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="setting up lower third" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nz4gwqb0pbfhfwc/Screenshot%202016-11-23%2010.04.34.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the setting to enable auto load and autoload last used lower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="auto reload settings" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zr12w8e7sf4wtu/Screenshot%202016-11-23%2010.05.34.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here&amp;rsquo;s me having reloaded the hangout and the saved presets have gone :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="saved presets missing :-(" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/24ik2p5qauunua6/Screenshot%202016-11-23%2010.07.36.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can see the names of the developers on the site.  I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+SamJoseph/posts/QyAdAzTXPuG"&gt;G+ post&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of days and then maybe reach out to the maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael wasn&amp;rsquo;t around so I reviewed PRs instead of pairing.  Felt good to get into the details of the new AsyncVoter React client and get to some other outstanding PRs.  PR review is what Premium members get priority on.  I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure if this is the key thing that Premium&amp;rsquo;s want, but reviewing PRs takes a lot of work and time, and I believe it is very beneficial for learning.  Other meetings in the day were one offs and can&amp;rsquo;t really be ESADed.  Other key area for ESADing is the edX and AV emailings.  I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got the Social Media update fairly automated.  It involves reviewing an older blog, tweaking and then pushing to Medium, which automatically pushes to Twitter and Facebook, although with boring &amp;ldquo;I just published&amp;rdquo; text.  I push to LinkedIn manually, but it&amp;rsquo;s the edX and AV emailings that are time consuming.  The edX ones go through mail chimp, but they don&amp;rsquo;t give me enough access to automate them.  For the AV mailings, I really need to look into the Amazon SES service.  I&amp;rsquo;m just finishing a run of mailing all the AV members individually through my Thunderbird client.  I have a couple of scripts to semi-automate this, but I am trying to reach out personally to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do feel a bit like a spammer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a one off, and I&amp;rsquo;m responding individually to every email back, and we&amp;rsquo;ve signed up about ten new premium members as a direct result of these personal mailings over the last two months.  Longer term we need some way of enabling people to opt-in/out of emails.  Lots to do there.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to try profiling a few more days to see if I can find some sweet spots to ESAD, and if you have suggestions about how I can operate more efficiently I&amp;rsquo;m all ears! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
