    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pair flying" src="/images/pairflying.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I graduated a distance-learning masters in applied mathematics. Every month, the university mailed me an A4 enveloppe containing the course support. I was supposed to learn from the course material and returned the completed assignments within a month. A month later, I would receive an answer key.Â Should I have a question, I could mail it to the professor and wait for his reply. The whole process was cumbersome. I was often behind schedule. Interactivity was near to zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I participated in the MOOC endeavour. The video of the instructor gave a feeling of a one-to-one training session. Discussion forums, deadlines, follow-up mails, peer-reviews grounded the learning process. There were meetups too. And a MOOC about Agile Development using Ruby On Rails offered remote pair-programming sessions between participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair-programmming reuses the rather old organizational pattern of pilot+copilot : double-check, higher focusing, external view, and stronger engagement. You may object that programming is very different from flying. Yes, it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming requires a strong level of accuracy too. Your pairing fellow is both a watch dog that tells you not to call a library without checking how it works, not to cut and paste code across your work, and an inspiration to experiment with new ways of coding. As some aerobatic aircrafts don&amp;rsquo;t include a copilot seat, some programs are implemented by lone wolves in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like teamviewer, logmein, skype, hangout or joinme have been instrumental to the success of remote pair working. There is still room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a face-to-face meeting, there is a desk between the two interlocutors. Webcams should recreate this confortable spacing. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a barber nor a dental professional!
2) Remote working platforms lack of interoperability. Some only run on Windows, some require to install a software, others are more suitable for mobile use&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t try to connect to hangout with skype
3) Security is a weak point for all of these platforms. Choosing which window you share, which you don&amp;rsquo;t, masking your passwords or your personal information are not intuitive. In my earlier days, I remembered displaying my passwords on a recorded session. Not so good a security practice!
4) Optimizing the screen definition so that everybody can watch comfortably is not supported either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desktop application from IDE to word processors will probably include some kind of remote pair working feature sooner or later. C9 already includes some simple pair-programming features, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs in the code? Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me, it&amp;rsquo;s my pair programming partner who fooled around!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another free refill?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free refill" src="/images/freerefill.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I undertook a training session targeting small business manager to teach them how to improve profitability of business projects. The course instructor showed us a rather clear way to deal with profitabiliy. First, you estimate your break-even hourly rate, based on your history. Then, you don&amp;rsquo;t sell any project under the bottom line. After that, you prioritize your work to put the highest priority on the most profitable projects. Finally, you keep any accepted project above the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to the execution. I began to schedule my workday according to business priorities preferably to a sense of urgency that overcame me before. Then, everytime I felt I was at risk to hit the bottom line, I shifted my attention towards what I really sold to the client annd I reduced my objectives accordingly. Finally, I was trying to become a project reviewer for a well known MOOC platform. But the hourly rate was much too low. I felt relief to drop my candidature. Paid projects management improved greatly. But, a significant part of my workday, dedicated to volunteer projects, was out of the scope of this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many commitments, workaholism, things we begin and we never achieve, any freelance worker faces these contradictions. The inherent contradiction is even stronger when you work on non-paid project. How to prioritize your volunteer works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten working hours a day is my upper limit, considering that I&amp;rsquo;m not a computer nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a family, hobbies, and a social life &amp;hellip; I was already busy ten hours a day. Adding anything to my schedule implied removing something else. I have been more or less active on professional social networks for three years. I first thought this commitment would improve my reputation and fuel my prospect pipeline. But in three years, the return was not very encouraging. I felt that my social network activity was fueled by bitterness or anxiety or ego or the three rather than by a clear sense of business opportunity! I decided to forget social networks. Two to three hours a week were freed thanks to this good resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to devote these hours to Agile Venture mob programming sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s a real community, with real developers. You can both learn by observing how skilled developers work and by doing things by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the midstream of my prioritization effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very actively participating in MOOCs for five years. My skills greatly improved as a result of this effort.  But choosing which courses to invest on is not easy. Knowledge is a bit like indirects costs. You don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to assign it to your achievements. During the first years, the offer flourished. I tried many courses, from Economy to Computer Sciences. I progressively focused on Computer Science and left courses as they switched to paid offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was giving up, a prominent MOOC platform offers me to beta-test courses for free. Free refill is the end of resolution and the beginning of passive hyperactivity! You may begin your training week with a course on Embedded systems and end, on friday, with a course on PythonML on friday, without completing any. Does it make sense to participate in a mob programming session about RSPEC on monday, another one about phoenix on wednesday, on the last one about React on friday, when you only need to develop a small web app with React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileVenture Premium Mob includes some kind of Professional Development Planning Support. I may ask the team to help me clean my training plan. But I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid they will tell me to stop learning Tensor Flow or the nitty gritty of Intel Parallel Architecture if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any prospect to work in these fields in the next year! &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve got some suggested channel greeter bot text from at least one project maintainer.  I&amp;rsquo;m also running behind today, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get the websiteone sign up changes deployed &amp;hellip; I checked the recaptcha sign up works on staging, which it does and filed a bug report about the double sign up message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1743"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1743&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stabbed around with the hangout and youtube notifications and am still not getting consistency, but the video play is still working in all the right places.  I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing the jitsy buttons on develop, which makes it seems like we had a deploy fail, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see that in the semaphore history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssmcw84gzal6u43/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.02.41.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ah, but they&amp;rsquo;re visible on the events, not projects.  Okay, that looks good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/90dboy3bg5qmm82/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.01.29.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well we might want to resize and/or provide some sort of flow here so that it&amp;rsquo;s clear what people should do.  What we could have is detected the button press, and then we could ping Slack that someone&amp;rsquo;s joining the hangout.  Okay, I think the plan should be to get the recaptcha stuff out onto production and tomorrow maybe I can review the site flow experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also tempted (though I&amp;rsquo;m over time) to try and get the project greeter bot able to mention the new user name &amp;hellip; and I did - thought not deployed - sent preview to project maintainer for approval:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/41xijwjt9186nx0/Screenshot%202017-07-19%2010.28.18.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just worrying if it&amp;rsquo;s a bit long &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I think I should step away from the project greeting bots and just check the new sign up flow as it gets deployed.  First thing is that I need reCaptcha keys on the heroku servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/9wti29f0ihs7s7e/Screenshot%202017-07-18%2009.39.37.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing that gives us the new reCaptcha sign up page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/hncj4kvhndkebst/Screenshot%202017-07-18%2009.44.07.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I manually test and it seems to work on develop and the rest of the site seems okay.  I notice that the new Jitsi button hasn&amp;rsquo;t been deployed, which likely means we have another intermittent failure on the CI and indeed we do.  For reference here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Given that there are 25 past scrums # features/step_definitions/scrums_steps.rb:28
      PG::UniqueViolation: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "index_users_on_slug"
      DETAIL:  Key (slug)=(zella-lubowitz) already exists.
      : INSERT INTO "users" ("first_name", "last_name", "email", "encrypted_password", "slug", "bio", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8) RETURNING "id" (ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique)
      ./features/step_definitions/scrums_steps.rb:29:in `/^that there are (\d+) past scrums$/'
      features/scrums.feature:8:in `Given that there are 25 past scrums'


      Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/scrums.feature:10 # Scenario: Scrums index page renders a timeline of scrums for users to view in descending order
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting a bit ridiculous recently and it feels like we are back to having a couple of intermittent fails before any CI build will complete.  They are usually JavaScript issues, but the one above is odd because it appears database related, but I guess it could still be some sort of JavaScript race condition.  Michael and I spent a lot of time sandboxing and re-implementing the cukes to reduce variability, but while things got better for a while, the problem is still there.  A short term fix is adding more of the regular culprits to the don&amp;rsquo;t run on CI list.   I wish there was a more consistent approach.  Maybe the Rails 5 upgrade might help, if we upgrade Capybara etc. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot do further testing on the flow through the system (or the new Jitsi buttons) until the CI passes again and deploys to either staging or develop.  It&amp;rsquo;s super frustrating when I want to stay focused at resolving usability issues in the interface that I&amp;rsquo;m getting distracted by the deploy logistics.  I wonder if the better solution is to avoid JavaScript dependent acceptance tests &amp;hellip; The difficulty with intermittent failures on CI is the feedback loop is so slow.  I guess we could start paying Semaphore for faster builds, but I think we&amp;rsquo;d need to bring in more funds to be able to afford that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well in the meantime I can ask all the project maintainers what message they&amp;rsquo;d like in their greeter bots &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="times up" src="/images/expired.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no one joined the LocalSupport channel over the weekend and thus there&amp;rsquo;s no immediate chance to see the new project greeting bot in action.  Other project maintainers have come back to me with mixed responses.  Some enthusiastic, some more cautious.  I also saw there are some &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq"&gt;special keys for testing &amp;ldquo;reCaptcha&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which makes me feel like I should put some more effort into that spike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what I really want though is to update the project greeting bot so that it supports multiple projects, mentions the person by name and even has a pause before it posts.  Force of habit&amp;ndash;I just dropped a load of issues in the repo for the bot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/1"&gt;mention name of member who joins channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/2"&gt;add pause to post so it&amp;rsquo;s not quite so fast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/3"&gt;support multiple projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/4"&gt;could this all be done with a slash command?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/5"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/6"&gt;easier in ruby?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s tempting when thinking about supporting multiple projects to put a database or caching system in there, but a hash in the code will do for now.  And I start to want to put a testing framework in there, but I know I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to easily round-trip the whole thing, so I do a manual test on the low level stuff in node, and on the high level stuff in a second Slack instance.  It all seems to work.  I could deploy.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got one free-tier member asking for a simple project to get set up on - it could be this one &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get the autograders working on EC2 and so many other things.  I can&amp;rsquo;t allow myself more than another 15 minutes on this.  I think I deploy.  Again by force of habit I submit a PR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/pull/7"&gt;https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/pull/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no CI yet, but it allows me to attach the ticket to the issue.  I could deploy that branch directly &amp;hellip;?  That actually provides a great route for getting out of trouble.  Will do that.  While that builds I could quickly make a test for the reCaptcha stuff &amp;hellip;?  I satisfy myself with creating a ticket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1735"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1735&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the new bot is deployed, and I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of other features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/8"&gt;avoid re-posting to the same person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/9"&gt;avoid posting if we&amp;rsquo;ve recently done so&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/10"&gt;should we prefer to DM people the intro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/project_greeter_bot/issues/11"&gt;allow people to request instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so many things that might or might not be useful &amp;hellip; anyway, times up &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="robots" src="/images/robots.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the discussion in marketing was about adding a time limit to the message about the Premium Mob special offer, and any changes can now be submitted as a pull request.  There also seemed to be general agreement that we should avoid bots doing the greeting of new members in the #new_members channel.  There was interest though in the idea of having bots greet new members when they joined project channels.  I also reached out to a few project managers and got positive responses to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that new members joining a channel doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate any kind of notification on Slack (at least on default settings) - having explained it to a few people and everyone agreeing that it means that we miss when members join new channels I just sent Slack a question about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if there is any setting in Slack that will allow channel joins to show up as a stronger notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment in our AgileVentures Slack, we get a little notice in the channel, e.g. Member name joined #general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I notice that the member joining doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause the channel to get the bold highlight as there is with a new message, and not the number that&amp;rsquo;s associated with being mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I can write a bot that will detect new members joining and a channel and responding to them, but is there a setting that allows us to adjust the notifications status of channel joins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to set it so that all members were bothered by channel joins, but it would be useful for admins, and perhaps nominated members of a channel who were focused on greeting activities.  Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not something in main Slack is there any plugin that already addresses this issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say I&amp;rsquo;ve been very tempted to rustle up a quick bot that will do some greetings for us.  I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be reviewing the AV website, but this has turned into a review of the AV ecosystem and I think that makes sense.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I should tinker more with the main website until I&amp;rsquo;ve got the results of the few experiments I&amp;rsquo;m running at the moment and in the flow through the site, that point when members join Slack channels seems pretty critical.  It&amp;rsquo;s also an opportunity to get set up with a deployment flow on the bot project.  Although, should it be part of the greeter bot, or a separate instance?  Either way I definitely want to test this on a separate Slack instance before dropping it on our main Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I was thinking of last night was whether we could have a bot like AsyncVoter that was activated by a slash command; then project managers could add the greeter bot to their channel, and then configure it themselves via Slack?  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure - I&amp;rsquo;ll have to enumerate all these different Slack integrations at some point.  Anyhow, I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself from quickly deploying another bot against a test Slack instance to see if I can get the basic channel greeting behaviour I want &amp;hellip; and thirty minutes later I have one deployed on Azure/Dokku, after a quick round of tests on a separate slack instance to find the exact notification I want to match, getting stuck on the syntax for environment variables on dokku, but I now have it live on the #localsupport channel.  The code is just this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var Botkit = require('botkit');

var controller = Botkit.slackbot({
  debug: false
});

var bot = controller.spawn({
  token: process.env.PROJECT_GREETER_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  retry: 20
}).startRTM()

var greet = "Welcome to LocalSupport! :slightly_smiling_face: To install the codebase see: https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/blob/develop/docs/installation.md#installation and our #localsupport-install channel if you need help"

greet += "\n\n\n see https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md for how to contribute to the project, but feel free to ask questions here too :-)"

controller.on('member_joined_channel', function(bot, message){
  // console.log('member_joined_channel')
  // bot.say({channel: message.channel, text: greet});
  if(message.channel === process.env.PROJECT_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID){
    bot.reply(message, greet);
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the deployment was just this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com apps:create projectgreeterbot-production
ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com config:set projectgreeterbot-production PROJECT_GREETER_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=XXXXX
ssh dokku@agileventures.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com config projectgreeterbot-production set PROJECT_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0KK907B5
git push azure-production master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with all the code at: https://github.com/tansaku/project&lt;em&gt;greeter&lt;/em&gt;bot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tunznnlxylbjteo/Screenshot%202017-07-14%2010.32.58.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we label it more clearly as a bot?  I have mixed feelings - I&amp;rsquo;d like people to feel they could reply directly to me using @tansaku, but perhaps it degrades my credibility as a real person on Slack &amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;
