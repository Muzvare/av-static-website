    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was basically coming back up to speed after a week away from digital communication, gradually transfering the various items from Email and Slack into my TODO list.  I managed to deploy the latest agile-bot config changes to production, do a marketing meeting and record an Agile Book Club podcast.  What was great to see was how active folks had been while I was away, greeting new members in the Slack, running the marketing meetings in my absence.  Lara has got in there and reconfigured the Google AdWords campaign; running experiments on different ads. We now have over 11,000 unique users visiting the site over the last month.  The AdWords signup tracking appears to be working, indicating 31 new member sign-ups after clicking on a Google ad.  Marufa came up with new designs for the pricing pages and Lara&amp;rsquo;s taking the lead on making the first round of tweaks there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re also starting to see more traffic to the non-profit static site, although it&amp;rsquo;s not clear what conversions we should be tracking there.  Michael is telling me that we should do a little less talking and focus on getting more things done.  Although I sometimes feel close to paralysis in terms of what to do next, or what to prioritise.  The Agile Book Club podcast is a great excuse for more conversation, which I do enjoy, and in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s episode I think we provided a forum for Michael to express various feelings he has about how AgileVentures projects don&amp;rsquo;t focus on the high level stories enough.  In the post-show chat our discussion honed those feelings into a plan of action.  Michael said that the reason he didn&amp;rsquo;t like the WSO team meetings of a few months back were that we were working through any and all tickets in the board.  That meant that issues raised by anyone could take the floor.  He&amp;rsquo;d be much more interested in a meeting where someone had reviewed all the tickets in advance of the meeting and then a set of the most important were pre-selected to be the subject of a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great idea, but a lot of up-front work for someone, so I suggested how about we have a meeting where we each bring a maximum of three tickets that we care about to plan for a sprint; and with luck we&amp;rsquo;ll do that on Friday.   It&amp;rsquo;s funny, because sometimes it seems that talking is what&amp;rsquo;s needed to help people get their feelings out, and then collaboratively work out a course of action.  As with all things it&amp;rsquo;s a balance.  What was also clear to me was a variation of my maxim of being careful when &amp;ldquo;blocking&amp;rdquo; people; which is that feedback can be mis-interpreted as a block, and the more people there are in a meeting, the less likely that feedback will be able to be constructively received.  By blocking I mean anything that contradicts what a person is saying, be it correcting their grammar, querying their choice of phrase, or disagreeing with their point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details, as interested parties can get that from the recording of the marketing meeting and the podcast etc., but I do keep coming back to advice I got from Ruben at Makers Academy that it&amp;rsquo;s far better to ask people questions than to make assertions.  For some reason I find it so hard to do that.  My M.O. is so ingrained that when someone makes an assertion that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit my mental model, my knee-jerk reaction is the make a counter-assertion.  I enjoy the mental interplay, but so many other people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to.  Of course asking too many questions can also be a block.  Let&amp;rsquo;s see, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to either shut up or just ask single questions for the rest of the week, if I can!  A little less conversation, a little more action maybe :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just had a complete break from Slack and email for a week.  That was nice, although I was starting to get a bit jittery towards the end.  Ever since my knee operation last October I&amp;rsquo;ve been a mail/slack addict on my phone, checking for updates first thing in the morning, last thing at night, at every time of the waking day.  Great for staying up to date with everything, but not too healthy I feel.  I think a complete break for a week was the right thing to do.  I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be back in the saddle today and I hope, going forward, that I can keep my digital checks into a 9am-9pm bracket - we&amp;rsquo;ll see :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was away from the digital fountain, I was reading &amp;ldquo;Doors of Perception&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Heaven and Hell&amp;rdquo; by Aldous Huxley, which was pretty discombobulating in his descriptions of taking mescalin, which match pretty closely to the descriptions of momentary Zen awareness in the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read (or am re-reading) by Steve Hagen and Eckhart Tolle.  Despite being away from digital communication media for the week I did do some further work on a sample book chapter for a book that might now be called &amp;ldquo;Agile Methods for Open Source Projects&amp;rdquo;, and even some coding on an alternative &amp;ldquo;inside-out&amp;rdquo; version of the TicTacToe technical test that FutureLearn gave me.  Those were quite relaxing activities, but the digital communication fast didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from worrying about &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;, the sustainability of the AgileVentures charity and relationships with different members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Steve Hagen and Eckhart Tolle talk about surrendering to the moment, which I did a fair bit, actually doing some sketching on a short trip away, focusing on the momentary experiences day by day, the food I eat, the feeling of picking up objects, of looking into the distance.  And after Huxley&amp;rsquo;s book, the folds in cloth and clothing, and flowers and surfaces.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I magically achieved any sartori, but I do feel closer to surrender.  The last 9 months I&amp;rsquo;ve been super-focused on pushing AgileVentures to the point where it could sustain myself and my family financially, and we&amp;rsquo;ve come some way along that path, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to surrender.  The AgileVentures charity might one day be able to support paying staff, but not for a while, and I think pushing too hard towards that goal is going to be detrimental to both me and the community, or at least counter-productive in terms of moment to moment experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to sustain my family I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to take other paying work for a while.  If I&amp;rsquo;m lucky then the meeting I have with FutureLearn on Tuesday will generate a framework where I can get paid for some of my time, and still have some spare time for the charity, which can chug along until I&amp;rsquo;ve rebuilt our savings again.  If I&amp;rsquo;m really lucky over the course of months (or possibly years) I can help the FutureLearn folks take their project open source and get some real synergy with the AgileVentures community, but I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too focused on any particular outcome.  The FutureLearn thing might not come off.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, I think that I&amp;rsquo;ll need to sink a load of my time into CodeMentor and HackHands to see if that can generate enough income, and if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, then look for something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking in terms of surrendering myself to my fate is helping me feel calmer about it all.  I also want to be listening more carefully to folks.  My insistent drive for efficiency and getting stuff done means that I am usually only half-concentrating when people are talking to me in meetings and scrums.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to see if I can change that; put the relationships with the other individuals in the community at higher value than getting things done.  Although I&amp;rsquo;m still terribly interested in the tweaks we can make that will make the community more sustainable.  The philosophy that I see through what I will currently call the Hagen/Tolle nexus is about detaching yourself from any outcome, and focusing on fully experiencing the current moment as much as possible.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean not seeking outcomes, but the more wrapped up you become in achieving a particular outcome the more you can end up pushing it away from you.  The universe flows around us and in us and through us and who knows what will crop up next.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to surrender to it and see where the flow takes me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m doing a tech test for FutureLearn and they&amp;rsquo;ve very kindly said that I can post my work publicly on GitHub, which I have promptly done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/tictactoe"&gt;https://github.com/tansaku/tictactoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about 3 hours on it so far, mostly in different leisure centers, churches and halls waiting for my children to finish sporting activities.   I get 45 minutes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays while I wait for them to finish WoodCraft, football and Karate respectively; during which I can focus on my laptop without too many interruptions.  In a bit of tech test flurry I created a calculator in Ruby for CodeMentor yesterday, which got approved this morning, and I was reminded of the period last year where I got pneumonia and spent three weeks in bed doing almost nothing but kata on &lt;a href="http://www.codewars.com/"&gt;CodeWars&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, I&amp;rsquo;d encountered variations on the CodeMentor tech test in CodeWars.  If you want to get good at TechTests you could do worse than spending a while hacking through the kata on CodeWars and other sites like HackerRank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Makers folks were overtaking my CodeWars score recently, but I think CodeWars just adjusted their calculations and I seem to have jumped back to the top of the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="codewars ranking for my allies" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xzq8o3mdiyqawmh/Screenshot%202017-02-10%2009.49.57.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which gives me ridiculous childish pleasure.  I&amp;rsquo;m so shallow &amp;hellip; (hangs head).  I&amp;rsquo;m still frustrated not to get to 1-kyu on CodeWars, even after I solved all the 1-kyu katas (1-kyus are the hardest).  Looks like there are now some new 1-kyu and 2-kyu katas that would allow me to get to 1-kyu without doing umpteen easier katas.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that if I have another major illness :-)  Anyhow, tech tests are a strange beast - little coding puzzles that companies hand out to potential hires to test their coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got into CodeWars because it was being recommended when I was a coach at MakersAcademy, and at the bootcamp we were focused on helping training folks up to be able to handle the tech tests that companies would give them after they graduated.  I previously did a worked tech test for the students there, the code for which you can see here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tansaku/vending-machine-kata"&gt;https://github.com/tansaku/vending-machine-kata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recorded screencasts of myself doing the entire thing to try and reveal the thought processes I was having as I went through it.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t have such fantastic feedback about it.  One junior staff member told me he thought the code made him &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo; and despite many other disucssions, I never got to discover what made him sad about it.  Another more senior staff member said that one student listening to the videos felt that it was too stop/start with me saying &amp;ldquo;umm&amp;rdquo; to much, which I can totally believe.  I think that lead to some scripted coding screencasts for the weekly challenges at Makers that ultimately were much more appreciated by the students.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;d been fun to do this TicTacToe tech test for FutureLearn, and I took an Outside-In approach, driving the code with acceptance tests, dropping down to some integration and unit tests. I got something that works more or less, in a single monolithic file, just pushing Sandi Metz&amp;rsquo; 100 line limit.  There&amp;rsquo;s something nerve-wracking for me, an academic by training, working with these industry tech tests.  I keep seeking that industry &amp;ldquo;special-sauce&amp;rdquo;.  The thing that makes the great coders.  My best guess at the moment is that actually it&amp;rsquo;s giving ground rather than fighting for a particular code style that is the key skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that confuses me is that we have directions like &amp;ldquo;do the simplest thing possible&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;always write your test first&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;red-green-refactor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;you ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna need it&amp;rdquo; and others, but when you take any of these to their logical extremes people seem to get uncomfortable.  This TicTacToe problem is clearly highly constrained, so an alternate approach to take would be to build a TicTacToe engine, driving the design with unit tests, and then wrapping acceptance tests around later (if at all).  I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a big fan of that sort of approach as I worry I&amp;rsquo;m going to burn too much time writing stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t need, and they&amp;rsquo;d said only spend a couple of hours on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to do the whole thing driven from RSpec to avoid burning time on Cucumber, and was interested to see if I could write complete acceptance tests for the input/output on the command line, so I drove in that way and got my single monolithic class.  At the moment I have a roughly working system, but only for a few hard-coded games.  The computer&amp;rsquo;s current strategy is fixed and I don&amp;rsquo;t handle collisions for markers, so the game is not fully generic.  The tech test is currently a reasonable demonstration of my ability to craft different kind of tests, get a roughly working system, but I&amp;rsquo;m suddenly paranoid about whether this code is going to make more people &amp;ldquo;sad&amp;rdquo; in some indeterminate way and I still won&amp;rsquo;t be able to get an example of a version that would make people &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine doing it again, driving from unit tests (with the benefit of the initial experience) to make a nicely factored engine.  I could also layer on some acceptance tests to make sure the other high level failures are addressed, e.g. collisions handled etc., or I could continue refactoring the code with the existing tests.  I&amp;rsquo;ve used the existing test suite to eliminate some unneeded code and make the method names more self-explanatory.  But how will people feel about the lack of comments?  I like to focus on making the method and variable names self-documenting.  Having got this far I feel like I won&amp;rsquo;t be happy until it plays a fully generic game.  I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending more time on it today before I send FutureLearn the link :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting response to one of &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2017/01/23/passing_a_threshold/"&gt;recent blog posts&lt;/a&gt; from an AV community member.  They posted the following in our community #random channel (where I had shared my blog post):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an additional source of income for AV, why not offer pairing sessions for payment for those who may be reluctant to commit to a monthly fee? These sessions could be given to mentors who would be paid a proportion of the fee, thus perhaps incentivising more mentor-type people to join as well. A bit similar to what AirPair used to do although perhaps more from a learning point of view rather than a professional problem solving one as that was. So perhaps a student could pay for a session on a particularly difficult piece of homework, or a private project they are doing, or to better learn some concept or technique they are having problems with, or even just to practice coding and pair programming but without having to commit themselves to working on a project, which might be intimidating to some (and pairing not always available). These students might also in future be drawn into collaborating on actual AV projects. But in any case the pairing sessions themselves would bring in additional income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another community member responded, soon after, that they would pay for individual mentoring sessions, and we spent a little time discussing things in the &amp;ldquo;Martin Fowler&amp;rdquo; scrum.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what happened to AirPair.  According to their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPair"&gt;wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; they raised over $1M after a Y Combinator presentation, but the site currently has some authentication errors and I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing any activity on the site or social media since mid-2016.  However, similar sites such as HackHands and CodeMentor seem to be &amp;hellip; oops, got distracted there.  I just went through the sign up processes for CodeMentor and HackHands.  Thought it would only take a couple of minutes, but CodeMentor included a timed assessment involving a pop quiz and a programming assignment.  Fortunately it was very similar to a kata I had completed not so long ago on Codewars, so I was able to polish it off pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, talk about being easily distracted! :-) At least I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a good insight into the sign up experiences of those two companies.  So what our community member is suggesting is a lot like what I think CodeMentor and HackHands are offering.  What&amp;rsquo;s not clear is how beneficial it would be for AgileVentures.  It feels like it will be difficult for us to compete with venture-backed companies in the same space, although as suggested, perhaps we focus more on the learning side? I was originally tempted to respond in #random with my philosophy of openness in AgileVentures, but thought I&amp;rsquo;d save it for this blog.  One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that when people are giving you suggestions, they are generally not interested in hearing that you thought about them already, or why you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken them up.  Far better to thank them for the great suggestions and ask simple follow up questions to find more about what they are thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to bring in more money to AgileVentures, but I find helping individuals on their specific closed-source issues somewhat challenging.  Specifically because you often can&amp;rsquo;t get the whole code system on your own machine quickly.  Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m a deeply flawed and impatient person, but I find it difficult to cope with making suggestions verbally and then having someone stumble around in their own interface, mis-interpreting what I&amp;rsquo;ve said.  I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what ScreenHero is for &amp;hellip; And maybe even uttering my honest thoughts here is self-destructive.  My hope with AgileVentures is to be doing the mentoring in the open, to enable more learners to learn from the contributions to open source projects.  Although I&amp;rsquo;ve come to see clearly that many learners crave privacy and are deeply embarrassed about asking questions in public, or in front of more than just a single mentor.  I assume this is all related to fear of failure, fear of being seen as less than competent etc.  I feel it to, but repeated practice has got me comfortable(-ish) with failing in public :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that our community member mentions not having to commit to a project.  From my point of view if you just make one comment in one of our PRs, or just get the code set up and then never do anything, it&amp;rsquo;s still a contribution.  It&amp;rsquo;s what a lot of people seem to do; but perhaps many more are put off by the perception of needing to commit to a project.   I guess my big worry is that for all the time I spend helping other individuals on their private projects and homeworks, I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any multiplier for the community.  I can&amp;rsquo;t share the code solution we discover, and I can&amp;rsquo;t share the video of the techniques we used to discover the solution; but then again how many others actually benefit from all the AV videos we&amp;rsquo;ve shared?  How many others are really following the support given in psuedo-public in Slack?  Maybe the majority are all just hideously embarrassed by all this and that&amp;rsquo;s why we keep struggling to achieve any sustained critical mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind does come round to feeling that the majority of people want polished content that they can consume in private.  There&amp;rsquo;s so much less pressure, it&amp;rsquo;s so much more convenient.  The cynic in me moans that so much of the polished content is not true to life, but then these days there are great screencasters out there (mainly outside of academia) showing folks how to actually do stuff, and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s always going to be more successful than a system that attempts to get the majority to overcome their fear of learning, of failing, in front of others &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog while text chatting with an HMRC tax representative trying to work out how to pay my tax bill online.  This is my get one item off my desk a day activity.  Just after writing that sentence I got to the tax representative and got guided through creating an online account, but the payment service is offline till Feb 17th, so I can&amp;rsquo;t technically clear my desk, since I&amp;rsquo;ll need to add an action item to my list, but at least I can clear away the paper bills and make them go &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo;.  I also signed up for paperless billing in the future, so hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll be less paperwork cluttering up my desk in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process for motivating oneself to get all these little things is strange, at least for me.  I really can&amp;rsquo;t bear the thought of working through all the papers on my desk.  Chipping away a little at a time seems like the only strategy.  What&amp;rsquo;s difficult and/or frustrating is the variable amounts of time that dealing with each individual &amp;ldquo;item&amp;rdquo; can take.  I&amp;rsquo;d been psyching myself up to get to this tax bill, clearing other items before it, and it had finally got to the top of my &amp;ldquo;mental&amp;rdquo; pile, if not the physical one.  As I was climbing the stairs today I said to myself &amp;ldquo;ah, I can just pay that directly from a different account, and avoid depleting the current account that I use for day to day affairs&amp;rdquo;.  Naively I thought I could just do a bank transfer, as I do for my company tax payments, but not so.  Once I&amp;rsquo;d pulled the bill out it only had a payslip.  I could have written a cheque and sent it off, but then it might come out of my account at an inconvenient moment and money is a little tight at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear the thought of phoning the tax office and going on hold, so I was pleased to be able to use their chat solution.  Ironically I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to pay, but at least I am now in principle set up to pay online before the deadline.  The whole process has taken up about 30 minutes, during which I might have been blogging more thoroughly, but there might be some long term gains, in terms of taking the process digital in future.  I reflect that one&amp;rsquo;s perception of how long things will take is affected by many factors, and that very often one&amp;rsquo;s estimates end up being faulty.  Spiritually I&amp;rsquo;m trying to really live in the moment, at the moment; and all moments :-), with varying degrees of success, but at least occasionally with laughter :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another version of me might have ranted about the lack of the UK government digital wherewithal, but they do seem to be going in the right direction.  Of course I think as a taxpayer I should have much more control about how the money I contribute is spent.  The democratic process of voting for a representative who will have some influence on my behalf seems remarkably error prone and imprecise.  Although that said, I have been having a productice conversation with my local M.P. (Gareth Thomas, Labour) about traffic safety near local schools.  More on that on another occasion, but I recently discovered there&amp;rsquo;s a name for the idea I&amp;rsquo;ve long held dear about individual taxpayers choosing where their tax goes.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_choice"&gt;Tax Choice&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently Romania has implemented it to some degree.  I was speaking to an extended family member from Romania over the break and hearing about how it&amp;rsquo;s something they have to register for, and some people do it and some people don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has a reasonable system, in my opinion, with contributions to non-profits being tax deductable, so you can effectively reduce your tax payments by choosing deserving causes.  It&amp;rsquo;s not quite the same however, as you&amp;rsquo;re not just allocating your tax, you&amp;rsquo;re also allocating your own funds as well.  In the UK we have GiftAid, which allows your charitable contributions to be added to by the government, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce your tax bill.  You can make tax-deductibale charitable contributions in the UK if you are a company, or if your employer is signed up to a just-giving scheme, which is all rather too complicated if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve totally got sidetracked from my intended focus on motivation, it does all link up.  People&amp;rsquo;s donation to charitable causes is going to be related to their perception of how easy it is to do, and the possible associated benefits to themselves.  Where I was thinking about motivation yesterday was how I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off promoting the &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org"&gt;AV nonprofits site&lt;/a&gt; that Michael, Raoul and I collaborated on last year.  We had some detailed constructive criticism from Freeranger that made me feel a little embarressed about distributing it widely.  We gradually worked through various of the issues, but there were a couple of wonky screenshots in the case-studies that I got stuck on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through all the little fixes I got distracted by implementing the payment frameworks in the main developer site, and getting new screenshots for the case-studies felt like a fiddling difficult thing.  At least partly because they were other projects and I was waiting on UI improvements to be implemented.  As we were discussing the non-profit site in the marketing meeting yesterday, I made a bit of a breakthrough to push it forward.  Lara had a great new UI design for the MetPlus project that I pulled in, and I went in and edited the SnowAngels UI myself.  The static site on middleman is actually super easy to change compared to some sorts of changes on the main developer site.  Within thirty minutes I had the changes up, and then in another thirty I had a couple of Google AdWords ads set up to try and help drive traffic to that site for charities and non-profits who might need IT solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels good to get it done, and funny in retrospect how it seemed such a blocker.  Will this generate any paying leads?  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.  It feels like there are a lot of other minor tweaks to be made in the &amp;ldquo;funnels&amp;rdquo; through the various sites that might lead developers and organisations to the point that they are contributing financially to the support of AgileVentures.  I did have a couple of hours spare for coding yesterday, but one went on ensuring all the Premium members are correctly represented in the database, and another hour went on a tech test that might lead to some income for me personally on a closed source project.  We&amp;rsquo;ve got a few more folks joinging the WebSiteOne project recently, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel in a position to assign folks to work on particular parts of the funnel.  Motivation is complicated and I think we need to allow things to drift into place rather than force them &amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to crash into other people&amp;rsquo;s motivation barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to be back blogging about code yesterday, but Monday didn&amp;rsquo;t see any further focus on code.  I replied to all the incoming Slack queries, but not all the emails, and fitted in a fair few meetings.  It had been a few weeks since we had a LocalSupport client meeting and we managed to sneak one in between the &amp;ldquo;Martin Fowler&amp;rdquo; scrum and the marketing meeting.  We were able to get five or six stories, chores and bug fixes accepted, and confirm the pivot from organization lising to volunteering; a thread that was picked up again in the Agile Book Club podcast later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a slew of new action items there for me to follow up on, and reminds me I&amp;rsquo;d love an automated bot to help me do project board review.  We&amp;rsquo;ve lost any structure to LocalSupport and WebSiteOne sprints since we&amp;rsquo;ve dropped explicit kick-off and retrospective meetings.  Maybe that means we&amp;rsquo;re just failing at Agile, but I feel rock-bottom in terms of motivation for those kinds of meetings given the low level of enthusiasm for them in the past.  Both projects are seeing a resurgence of activity recently so maybe we should bring them back in at some point, but I&amp;rsquo;m also enamoured with the idea of doing everything in a distributed asynchronous fashion using voting bots and project management bots.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight we managed a vote in WebSiteOne, and I started getting set up with Arreche&amp;rsquo;s reworked slack integration bot that will hopefully provide a simpler interface and support multiple votes in parallel.   One step at a time, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help speculating about a project bot that would automate, or semi-automate working through the project boards.  I think the boards need to be reviewed once a week and every &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; ticket needs to be checked on.  The heuristic I use is to check if there&amp;rsquo;s been any activity in the last couple of days from the person taking the lead on the ticket.  If they&amp;rsquo;ve pushed commits to a PR, added comments to the tickets then it can be left, but if there&amp;rsquo;s been no activity of a while they need to be pinged to check on the status, see if the item can be re-assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full automation would be hard, but a semi-automated approach that presented each ticket in turn with its &amp;ldquo;state of decay&amp;rdquo; would be something to help reduce effort on the part of the project manager.  Even just a repeating alert to make sure the review was performed weekly would be helpful.  Maybe I should have had a quiet half hour to do that after the the client meeting, but I was straight into the marketing meeting as we reviewed our Google AdWords campaign performance, draft newsletter and content marketing strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to leave marketing early to pair with Corey on a sticky point on WebSiteOne, where we&amp;rsquo;d been going back in forth in a pull request to little apparent progress.  Once again the magic of the realtime hangout got us sorted.  I properly understood the problem that Corey was facing, which was writing an acceptance test for the the pop-up countdown timer.  Corey had been able to make it work by switching the Capybara driver from poltergeist to webkit, but that had the unfortunate side-effect of breaking a lot of other tests.  I was pretty sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to switch the driver to get this to work, or at least pretty much anything else would be less effort than fixing all the other mercury editor related tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the debugger to see that the event countdown was present in the code being returned by the poltergeist driver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"hidden-sm hidden-xs hidden-md"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"next-event"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-time=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"2014-02-03T07:00:00+00:00"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/events/scrum"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Scrum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/events/scrum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Scrum&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; is live!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the clean output was the usual pain that made me think there must be a better way to get formatted HTML output on the irb/byebug prompt.  So much so that I just took a blog break to file an &lt;a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/327"&gt;issue on byebug&lt;/a&gt; and research the matter.  Corey wondered if the screen width might be an issue and a quick google got us to the solution which was a step to increase the width of the virtual browser so that the popup would be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^the window size is wide$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;Capybara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;current_window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;resize_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess I lied, there was a tiny chunk of coding focus in the middle of the day. Then it was lunch and &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo; scrum and drie meeting catch up (they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to build the dashboard themselves), and Agile Book Club podcast episode 2, which was great fun.  I bought the three pack of e-books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Retrospectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great day really.  Now I just have to make sure that I follow up with the LocalSupport project elements, and get out some code to start tracking the sign ups that are coming in through the Google AdWords campaign.  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stay focused on the moment and not worry too much about how every little step adds up to any particular long term goal. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what today brings :-)&lt;/p&gt;
