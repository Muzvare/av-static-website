    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to be back blogging about code yesterday, but Monday didn&amp;rsquo;t see any further focus on code.  I replied to all the incoming Slack queries, but not all the emails, and fitted in a fair few meetings.  It had been a few weeks since we had a LocalSupport client meeting and we managed to sneak one in between the &amp;ldquo;Martin Fowler&amp;rdquo; scrum and the marketing meeting.  We were able to get five or six stories, chores and bug fixes accepted, and confirm the pivot from organization lising to volunteering; a thread that was picked up again in the Agile Book Club podcast later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a slew of new action items there for me to follow up on, and reminds me I&amp;rsquo;d love an automated bot to help me do project board review.  We&amp;rsquo;ve lost any structure to LocalSupport and WebSiteOne sprints since we&amp;rsquo;ve dropped explicit kick-off and retrospective meetings.  Maybe that means we&amp;rsquo;re just failing at Agile, but I feel rock-bottom in terms of motivation for those kinds of meetings given the low level of enthusiasm for them in the past.  Both projects are seeing a resurgence of activity recently so maybe we should bring them back in at some point, but I&amp;rsquo;m also enamoured with the idea of doing everything in a distributed asynchronous fashion using voting bots and project management bots.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight we managed a vote in WebSiteOne, and I started getting set up with Arreche&amp;rsquo;s reworked slack integration bot that will hopefully provide a simpler interface and support multiple votes in parallel.   One step at a time, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help speculating about a project bot that would automate, or semi-automate working through the project boards.  I think the boards need to be reviewed once a week and every &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; ticket needs to be checked on.  The heuristic I use is to check if there&amp;rsquo;s been any activity in the last couple of days from the person taking the lead on the ticket.  If they&amp;rsquo;ve pushed commits to a PR, added comments to the tickets then it can be left, but if there&amp;rsquo;s been no activity of a while they need to be pinged to check on the status, see if the item can be re-assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full automation would be hard, but a semi-automated approach that presented each ticket in turn with its &amp;ldquo;state of decay&amp;rdquo; would be something to help reduce effort on the part of the project manager.  Even just a repeating alert to make sure the review was performed weekly would be helpful.  Maybe I should have had a quiet half hour to do that after the the client meeting, but I was straight into the marketing meeting as we reviewed our Google AdWords campaign performance, draft newsletter and content marketing strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to leave marketing early to pair with Corey on a sticky point on WebSiteOne, where we&amp;rsquo;d been going back in forth in a pull request to little apparent progress.  Once again the magic of the realtime hangout got us sorted.  I properly understood the problem that Corey was facing, which was writing an acceptance test for the the pop-up countdown timer.  Corey had been able to make it work by switching the Capybara driver from poltergeist to webkit, but that had the unfortunate side-effect of breaking a lot of other tests.  I was pretty sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to switch the driver to get this to work, or at least pretty much anything else would be less effort than fixing all the other mercury editor related tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the debugger to see that the event countdown was present in the code being returned by the poltergeist driver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"hidden-sm hidden-xs hidden-md"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"next-event"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-time=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"2014-02-03T07:00:00+00:00"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/events/scrum"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-event-name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Scrum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/events/scrum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Scrum&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; is live!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the clean output was the usual pain that made me think there must be a better way to get formatted HTML output on the irb/byebug prompt.  So much so that I just took a blog break to file an &lt;a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/issues/327"&gt;issue on byebug&lt;/a&gt; and research the matter.  Corey wondered if the screen width might be an issue and a quick google got us to the solution which was a step to increase the width of the virtual browser so that the popup would be shown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^the window size is wide$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;Capybara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;current_window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;resize_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess I lied, there was a tiny chunk of coding focus in the middle of the day. Then it was lunch and &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo; scrum and drie meeting catch up (they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to build the dashboard themselves), and Agile Book Club podcast episode 2, which was great fun.  I bought the three pack of e-books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve your Retrospectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great day really.  Now I just have to make sure that I follow up with the LocalSupport project elements, and get out some code to start tracking the sign ups that are coming in through the Google AdWords campaign.  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stay focused on the moment and not worry too much about how every little step adds up to any particular long term goal. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what today brings :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over Thursday and Friday I pushed out what I&amp;rsquo;m calling an &amp;ldquo;escalating call to action&amp;rdquo; on the main AgileVentures site.  The idea had come up in a discussion with Michael in a scrum earlier in the week in which we&amp;rsquo;d been talking about what to display when the user was already logged in, because our initial stab at a call to action &amp;ldquo;Sign up now to start coding&amp;rdquo; was being shown to all users, independent of their logged in status:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;quot;Sign up now to start coding&amp;quot; banner button" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yx69fbv0axhe7kc/Screenshot%202017-02-06%2009.37.58.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impetus to create/add this single &amp;ldquo;call to action&amp;rdquo; had come from a marketing meeting at the beginning of the week where we were looking at the sign up stats, and thinking in terms of funnels through the site.  Of course like all things there were many connections.  Ashley had talked a few months back about the site not really directing folks to take a particular action.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been agitating to think about things in terms of the lean startup funnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lean startup funnel" src="https://leansteps.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/funnel.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed to follow naturally that we might make the call to action vary according to the status of who was on the site, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guest User &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Sign Up now to start coding!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logged in User &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Upgrade to Premium for more support&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium User &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;  &amp;ldquo;Upgrade to Premium Mob for group sessions with a Mentor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening I spiked the view like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Basic'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium for additional support'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Premium'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;plan: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'premiummob'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium Mob for group sessions with a Mentor'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_user_registration_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Sign up now to start coding!'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary btn-block call-to-action "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"margin: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is nasty logic in the view, but it was also an experiment.  I wanted to focus on the business logic in one place, not on the process of pulling that business logic into a model or service.  If I had a secure income it might be another story, but I got something basic working.  Then I wrapped it in tests, breaking it as I went along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight gherkin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;@vcr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Escalating Call to Action
  As a site admin
  So that we can move towards sustainability
  I would like users to see an escalating call to action depending on their subscription

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; the following plans exist
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;free_trial_length_days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Premium&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;premium&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Premium&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mob&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;premiummob&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;2500&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Guest user sees call to action which links to sign up page
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; I am on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"home"&lt;/span&gt; page
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt; I click &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sign up now to start coding!"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; I should be on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"sign up"&lt;/span&gt; page

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Logged in user sees call to action which links to premium subscription page
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; I am logged in
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; I am on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"home"&lt;/span&gt; page
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt; I click &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Upgrade to Premium for additional support"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; I should be on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"premium sign up"&lt;/span&gt; page

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;@stripe_javascript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;@javascript&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Premium user sees call to action which links to premium mob subscription page
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; I am logged in as a premium user with name &lt;span class="s"&gt;"John"&lt;/span&gt;, email &lt;span class="s"&gt;"john@gmail.com"&lt;/span&gt;, with password &lt;span class="s"&gt;"12345678"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt; I click &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Upgrade to Premium Mob for group sessions with a Mentor"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; I should be on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"premium mob sign up"&lt;/span&gt; page
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically the tests took twice as long to write as the code, mainly due to a Capybara issue with the step that checks that we&amp;rsquo;ve arrived on the correct page, which had to be evolved from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^I should be on the "([^"]*)" page$/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^I should be on the "([^"]*)" page$/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_fullpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;current_fullpath&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;request_uri&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after consulting various StackOverflow posts on the subject.  The issue here was that in the (older?) version of Capybara that we are using, the current_path returns the path without the URL params e.g. &lt;code&gt;plan=premiummob&lt;/code&gt;, which we need, due to the current design of the subscription controller.  Of course even just writing this down I come back to thoughts from a couple of months back about refactoring the URLs to nest so we could have &lt;code&gt;/plan/premiummob/subscriptions/new&lt;/code&gt;.  Gosh, there&amp;rsquo;s just endless extra refactoring we could be doing before being able to conduct experiments on the business logic itself :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, that was all working and I pushed it out in the background of Friday, and as far as I can tell it&amp;rsquo;s been running over the weekend.  I was in perhaps a hasty rush to put this up.  A last gasp of me being focused on promoting the Premium plans.  There&amp;rsquo;s been no sudden flurry of Premium or Premium Mob sign ups over the weekend :-) It seems like the increase in basic signups is holding steady in a way I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect unless the MOOC was active, although that might just be my imagination.  In the same deploy I got the adwords Premium plan conversion live, so if anyone else does convert we can in principle track where they are coming from, but it follows that we should really get the basic sign up AdWord conversion tracking up, and get better stats on the influx of new users, if we&amp;rsquo;re interested in working out how much impact these site changes and AdWord campaigns are really having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again my latest resurgence of Buddhist/Mindful thought is suggesting that strenuous effort in any direction is likely to be counter-productive.  That&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be particularly true for enlightenment.  I love Steve Hagen&amp;rsquo;s metaphor of an archery target.  With enlightenment apparently the closer you get to the center, the further away you actually are.  Somehow you are closest to dead center when you are totally on the periphery.  A pattern I do perceive is how my streneous attempts to resist things will bring them on more strongly or my attempt to grasp them will push them further from me.  It sort of feels like I am caught in a very strange counter-intuitive mental puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperately struggling to try and increase the number of Premium members in AgileVentures may actually make it harder to achieve that end goal.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to be a lot more relaxed about all this.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that hurrying is going to get me anywhere pleasant.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably just going to make the current moment hurried and unpleasant.  Everything just is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to focus on the right thing.  From a Buddhist perspective maybe the right thing to focus on is the here and now, the precious moment of current perception, at least where possible.  Still I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by this notion that one can use reason and data-analysis to work out how to achieve certain goals.  From a spiritual position, maybe being attached either way to the outcome of your goals is just going to lead to pain and disappointment?  I really don&amp;rsquo;t know :-) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a new Premium member sign up yesterday.  I have a suspicion that our Google AdWords campaign might be helping.  The Google analytics interface showed me that the number of folks looking at a Premium payment page had increased by 1, and that this came from someone clicking through on our ad when they had been conducting a search with the word &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;, one that we&amp;rsquo;d added last week after following suggestions from the AdWords interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hits on premium payment pages from &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;coding&amp;quot;" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jm3v72nx3jcj4v/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2009.57.27.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were welcoming the new Premium member into the AV Premium Slack it turned out that one of the Mentors knew them and, asking in a DM, I found out that that Mentor had recommended joining AgileVentures some time back.  I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1545"&gt;adding the AdWords scripts&lt;/a&gt; that should allow us to track purchase completions on the site, which should provide better information in the future, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to think about the multi-dimensional nature of this process where an individual will, of course, be influenced by many things before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s very interesting is to look at the data about folks coming to our free signup page over the last seven days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="a week of sign up page activity" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/01zcjl43h6vfnk1/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.07.07.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four days ago we rolled out Michael&amp;rsquo;s enhanced call to action and the trend does seem to be up since then.  We also rolled out the additional keywords at the same time, so it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to make a watertight case for one or the other being solely responsible.  However more click throughs to the sign up page implies an increase in the number of folks considering signing up, which seems like a good thing.   I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s worth setting up A/B tests?  Right now I&amp;rsquo;m focused on the idea of an escalating call to action whereby we provide a button in the same prominent place as the current &amp;ldquo;Sign up now to start coding!&amp;rdquo; that says &amp;ldquo;Upgrade to Premium for additional support&amp;rdquo; for those who are already signed up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="current call to action when not signed in" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvxg55gju8re883/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.10.23.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d spent the last few days dedicating most of my time to a project proposal for the drie folks, since that has the potential to bring in a lot of revenue, but they&amp;rsquo;ve demurred on that, so my focus swings back to seeing if we can get the Premium income to a level that will be sustainable.  I really don&amp;rsquo;t know.  Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll end up destroying the soul of the community with prominent calls to upgrade to Premium.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m better off not trying to push the community towards generating enough revenue so that I can continue focusing on it full time?  Perhaps it should be just left alone, and I should go off and do contracting on other projects that won&amp;rsquo;t synergise with AgileVentures.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My furious task-switching comes from trying to focus on the thing that will bring in enough funds to support my family - perhaps I need to detach myself from that outcome in order to be truly happy?  There are loads of little issues with the site I&amp;rsquo;d love to fix.  I have a suspicion that the site performance may be deteriorating under the increasing load, or is that just my imagination?  The production site hasn&amp;rsquo;t been slow any time I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to load it, and no one has complained to me directly.  What we can clearly see is nearly a five-fold increase in sessions on the site since the AdWords campaign kicked off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="activity over the last month" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jyiq5cq82zey5wq/Screenshot%202017-02-03%2010.17.27.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only see the last seven days on the NewRelic tracking of the site performance - seems like we&amp;rsquo;d have to upgrade to see more.  I just applied to their nonprofit program to see if we can get that at a discount.  NewRelic is showing our Apdex score dropping below 0.7 a couple of times a day, which means that sometimes folks are trying to load the site and not getting a page.  I started off the EventManager project for a couple of Premium F2F folks (who&amp;rsquo;ve since downgraded to Premium) as a place to experiment with Rails 5 websockets.  I started talking about a possible MicroServices architecture and now Matt is researching CDNs and ways to have the same assets served to different servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have to be super-careful going for my focus on effectiveness.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to be throwing all (the minimal) development resources we have into the place that will give us the most bang for the buck.  At the same time, pushing people away from their intuitions from what they think is important and towards the ones I think will gain traction can easily be counter-productive.  There are feelings to be hurt, egos to be bruised, and ultimately I don&amp;rsquo;t know if my ideas are better than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s.  Still I&amp;rsquo;m enchanted by the idea of having an open mind to overturning assumptions about what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t needed.  At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m telling myself that if I can just get this escalating call to action feature out, I&amp;rsquo;ll have done the basics, and can move into a more relaxed posture :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the basics I mean that by rolling out the Premium plans and payment frameworks I&amp;rsquo;ve demonstrated that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to derive some income through this mechanism.  Now of course Bloc and others are already an existence proof that it&amp;rsquo;s possible for others to derive income online from mentoring services, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got it set up and working for us.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got the charity red-tape sorted, the bank account set up, we&amp;rsquo;re taking payments, covering our server costs and then some.  And all that without aggressively promoting Premium.  So, now, what&amp;rsquo;s the way to sustainability?  Can the offering be improved? Certainly.  Can the way it is described and featured on the individual Premium pages be improved?  Certainly.  Can the site and entire community be fixed up and supported better?  I&amp;rsquo;m sure of it.  However I feel like we&amp;rsquo;ve got to take that last step of actually letting people know directly on the site that this pathway is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even having done so, there&amp;rsquo;ll be loads of little smoothings and tweakings to make the flow along that pathway smoother.  I hope the presence of a smooth pathway won&amp;rsquo;t ulimately be off-putting and counter-productive.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to continue devoting my full-time efforts to AgileVentures for the years to come, but I can&amp;rsquo;t do that unless the pathway is delivering the income to support myself and my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should end there, but of course the imagined pathway of signing up to the site, and then upgrading to Premium and Premium Mob etc. is not the only pathway.  There&amp;rsquo;s the pathway for sponsors, paid projects and so forth.  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep task-switching and chasing the dream that all this can sustain my full time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thomas asked a great question to DHH during our chat with him on Tuesday.  The question was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the biggest challenges of running a large scale open source project over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHH answered in some detail, but the point that&amp;rsquo;s stuck in my mind is that he said how difficult it was to be discussing absolutely everything in the full public spotlight on open mailing lists.  He said that over time they have evolved towards having private groups where discussion can move a bit faster.  I strongly believe in transparency as being a great enabler of trust and learning, but I would have to concur that doing absolutely everything in the open raises its own challenges.  For better or worse people will express different opinions in private and 121 discussions versus what they will say in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHH also brought up the point that when the discussion is open to everyone, it creates the situation where anyone can bring their opinion, and that opinion might be well-informed and considered or it might be reactionary, or not so well-informed, or some combination.  I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated about the difference between people.  Some will be ultra-cautious about expressing an opinion, while others will have an opinion on everything and will express it regardless of the consequences.  Those are extremes and different people occupy different positions along the spectrum, varying over the course of their lives and sometimes even over the course of a day or a conversation.  I&amp;rsquo;m not casting judgement on others here.  I totally include my own behaviour in this reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, so the thing blotting out my sun at the moment is the process of negotiating and estimating for the drie dashboard project.  I&amp;rsquo;m really excited that drie have agreed to go with an open-source project as this massively increases the learning opportunities for our community, but since they are a for-profit company I have to think carefully about how we are structuring this.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently running this as a project for my own for-profit company, NeuroGrid, and will sub-contract out components of it to individuals wanting to work on it.  What I&amp;rsquo;d also like to do is have a public channel for the project on the AgileVentures Slack so that everyone in AgileVentures can learn from the process and the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past when we&amp;rsquo;ve had paid projects from Non-Profit groups I was keen to share and make public the full estimating and negotiating process as a learning experience for all.  In this case I&amp;rsquo;ve demurred.  Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being too conservative, but I&amp;rsquo;m keeping the negotiating and estimating portion as a private conversation between NeuroGrid and drie.  While I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s lots that everyone could learn from making that process transparent, it&amp;rsquo;s already a big leap for drie to agree to our open source, open development model, and I&amp;rsquo;d hate to jeopardize that by pushing for further transparency.  Hopefully once we&amp;rsquo;ve established the work model for all this we can go even further, but&amp;ndash;bottom line&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to trust my intuition for what will work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really exciting is the opportunity to have AgileVentures members compensated for the skills they&amp;rsquo;ve been so dilligently developing on all the volunteer non-profit projects we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on over the last few years.  I ardently hope that an injection of income will invigorate rather than corrupt our community.  More news here as soon as we make it :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microservices vs Monolith</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Full on day yesterday with Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) dropping by to chat to AgileVentures and CraftAcademy, as well as other wall to wall meetings and DevOps.  Big shout-out to AgileVentures CoFounder and CraftAcademy boss, Thomas Ochman, for arranging and chairing the session.  It was great to hear from DHH in person and he was on form with his usual colorful language.  Thomas pointed us recently to a &lt;a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616681055"&gt;paper that indicated a positive correlation between profanity and honesty&lt;/a&gt;. DHH said things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone starts out being a shitty programmer writing shitty code, but the great thing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and went on to tell us about how he looks back disfavourably at code he wrote in the past.  I believe the point that DHH is making is that it&amp;rsquo;s okay to start slow and make mistakes and that&amp;rsquo;s just part of the process.  To his great credit he elaborated about that eloquently and effectively, and I think despairingly about my own public speaking skills.  I guess I should think that everyone starts out being a shitty public speaker giving shitty speeches, but the great thing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop there.  What worries me is how I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking too fast and cutting myself off in the middle of sentences for years :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we believe the academic study mentioned above, perhaps the use of profanity indicates there&amp;rsquo;s greater honesty in statements involving profanity, or by those who frequently profane, but if I&amp;rsquo;m honest I have to admit that profanity makes me uncomfortable.  I think that says more about me than it does about anything else.  I associate profanity with anger.  I swear when I&amp;rsquo;m angry, as my father did when he was angry.  I avoid it otherwise, as did he.  I find intense anger unpleasant and very sticky mentally.  If someone gets angry at me I find I am thinking about it for days.  DHH did not come across at all angry and was making a great point that I heartily agree with; even if I might have chosen slightly different words :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to look at how the authors of the academic study were measuring honesty in the facebook posts they were analyzing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honesty &amp;hellip; was assessed following the approach &amp;hellip; that liars use fewer first person pronouns (e.g., I, me), fewer third-person pronouns (e.g., she, their), fewer exclusive words (e.g., but, exclude), more motion verbs (e.g., arrive, go), and more negative words (e.g., worried, fearful). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This apparently comes from liars trying to dissociate themselves from the lie and so avoiding self-reference; preferring concrete over abstract language; using simpler language to reduce the mental load from generating the lie and using more negative terms because they are feeling uncomfortable about the lie.  Particularly interesting is that this entire analysis is entirely about expressions that people make on facebook, but enough of that rabbit hole.  Even more interesting to me was that DHH said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;only use micro services when no one person can understand the single app - don&amp;rsquo;t use micro services until you are ready to declare that &amp;ldquo;intellectual bankruptcy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a great point, but I wondered if that still applies when you have lots of part time, volunteer folks rather than a full time team, where everyone can devote themselves full time to understanding the entire system.  After the meeting, I posed that question to the AV community in Slack.  Long time AV contributer and software magician, Bryan Yap, responded that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every project still has a project lead, I imagine the project lead would know a considerable amount about the app. I think it is more for when the app grows too complicated for any one person to comprehend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it seems to be a common misconception that micro-services would solve a lot of the problems in an app, speaking to people more experienced than I am suggests the opposite :-) micro services only amplify the issues that already exist within an application. Micro services are good at solving the organisational issues as DHH mentioned, but technically it is much more difficult to manage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan went on to say that he didn&amp;rsquo;t see any benefit from moving from a clean monolith to micro services, because you just distribute your system and start to introduce consistency problems.  Of course that assumes you have a clean monolith, which can sometimes be a big ask. To me the biggest danger would be to say a priori that either a monolith or microservices is necessarily better. There are pros and cons for both, but what I was really trying to explore was DHH&amp;rsquo;s statement about not breaking the monolith until one person can&amp;rsquo;t fit it in their head. I think individuals have different capacities to fit things in their head depending on how much time they can devote to a project &amp;hellip;  As the conversation continued, Arreche chimed in with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise people coincide that it is safer starting with monolithic and move later to microservices when and if it is needed.
But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we cannot learn and experiment with microservices building not critical things. The AV community is a great place to have this kind of experiences indeed :slightly&lt;em&gt;smiling&lt;/em&gt;face: (edited)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which Bryan responded: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah experimentation is good :slightly&lt;em&gt;smiling&lt;/em&gt;face: but from experience, moving to a micro service when you are not ready is very painful. Having them in a single database is not necessarily a bad thing, it&amp;rsquo;s much faster to manage updates across the entire system because it is all in one place. When you need to make changes that span multiple projects with different teams… thats when all the problems kick in :disappointed: so having a good domain model and setting the right domain boundaries is necessary before moving to micro services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replied to Bryan that that was good advice, and that single databases are great in the right circumstances and getting that good domain model is key.  In my experience the difficulty is working out that domain model, since it requires a process of exploration.  In addition, if you have a project with a lot of part-time occasional folks who don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the time or inclination to understand the domain model, then it maybe makes sense to have a series of smaller services, each with a simpler model that they&amp;rsquo;re more likely to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Bryan&amp;rsquo;s point that there is usually one full-time maintainer who has the whole app in their head, but even if they do, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s necessarily the best criteria to make the decision to start splitting out some microservices. The key distinction I was trying to draw is that the best approach for a project where you have 6 full-time programmers on staff, may not work quite so well when you have one part-time person and 30 volunteers putting in bits of code here and there.  Sometimes splitting those 30 folks up into 6 teams of 5 each working on a different microservice might actually be simpler.  Of course as Kent Beck says, it depends :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a busy Monday with us recording the first of our &amp;ldquo;Agile Book Club&amp;rdquo; podcasts, and other back to back meetings.  There&amp;rsquo;s lots to discuss and plan on the marketing front, now that the Google AdWords grant is driving five times the usual traffic to our site.  However the biggest news of the day was a proposed paid project from our sponsor, drie.  drie wants to move fast to get their products onto the AWS Marketplace and they need a dashboard to go with their GitHub integration to allow users to manage their deployments to the drie cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paid projects have been a core concept of the AgileVentures Premium plans strategy since their inception. The idea is that signing up for a Premium plan subscription makes a member eligible for consideration for a paid project.  It&amp;rsquo;s intended as an incentive to sign up for Premium plans, and also a demonstration of commitment on the part of the member.  We&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of small paid projects in the past, and including eligibility for those projects as part of the Premium package is motivated by the experience on some of those earlier projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unpaid project it&amp;rsquo;s easy for the learning experience of the participants to be first and foremost.  They are after all putting in their time voluntarily.  In a paid project the situation changes; additional funds are being contributed by the client to ensure that some functionality is available in a particular timeframe.  There&amp;rsquo;s clearly little motivation for a client to contribute those funds if the sole objective is the learning experience for the developers.  There&amp;rsquo;s a tension here.  If the objective was simply learning and not on the product being generated, then perhaps those funds might be better contributed to a university or other institution which has learning as the sole objective?  Perhaps, but what about when the objective on the part of the learners is to become proficient at delivering products in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpaid projects in AgileVentures still have real clients and real requirements to simulate a real paid project, but with much less pressure.  In a paid project that pressure is there.  It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic learning opportuniry and an important resume addition; that you are a developer who has been paid to produce some code.  Maybe that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make much difference, but it seems to be important to many employers and recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;drie have generated a backlog of stories for us, of which six have been given top priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight gherkin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to see which of my repos drie would build and tell drie which it should build. 
&lt;span class="err"&gt;So&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;that,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;drie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;builds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want built and not the ones I dont want built

&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;pushed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; change
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to see if it built successfully and if there are changes that failed.

&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;built&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; branch 
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to see the build logs 
&lt;span class="err"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; can debug why the build failed

&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; user
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to be able to access the URL to my running app

&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;running&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; app, 
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to see the applications logs 
&lt;span class="err"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; can debug why its not working

&lt;span class="err"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; user 
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; want to log into my dashboard using github
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our meeting yesterday we talked through these top six stories and I made additional notes in the Trello cards to do my best to capture the nuances of what the client wanted.  I also pulled in screenshots from other existing systems that have parallel with the kinds of things they want.  drie has committed to making the whole project open source, which ticks important boxes for us at AgileVentures, where one of our twin goals is learning.  We avoid working on closed-source projects because of the difficulty this presents in terms of sharing the learning experience with the rest of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to come up with a budget for getting this done, and getting it done within a 2 to 3 week timeframe.  We have a pool of 30 premium members who are eligible to be involved with the project.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got to perform a complex series of calculations to ensure that drie gets value for money, that we have the right number of sufficiently experienced folks on the team, and that I get compensated for my own time while simultaneously not driving myself into the ground AND keeping all the other different parts of AgileVentures ticking along.  No pressure then :-)&lt;/p&gt;
