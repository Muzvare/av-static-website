&lt;p&gt;So after taking a full week away from Slack and Email I managed to start work again without too much obsessive checking of Slack and Email on my phone.  At least for the last ten days I&amp;rsquo;m not checking it when I first wake up and, instead, leaving it till after my morning blog.  I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much avoiding looking at it during the evenings, although I tend to have a last Slack check around 9:30pm when I post my blog.  Pretty good for a week and a half, but last night I ended up looking at my email while my eldest was reading to me, and then this morning I ended up looking at it while I was getting dressed, as I tried to send myself a reminder email.  There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything urgent to deal with, but in both cases I did manage to load chunks of work worry into my mind.  And then just now I seem to have reviewed all my Email and Slack before getting down to the blog.  There wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much to deal with, but I feel a little unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need to move the Slack and Email icons on my phone deeper into a nested directory and make sure that I shut down Slack and Email when I finish on my laptop each day, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally look at them before blogging.  My tweet/slacking of the podcast I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to in the morning interferes with that.  I guess I should get into the habit of tweeting and then re-posting that to Slack after the morning blog is completed.  Not that I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I&amp;rsquo;m achieving much with the blogging.  It may be an interesting historical record to look back on for me.  Not sure about anyone else :-)   I continue to post out older blogs on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@tansakuu"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.  My blogs from last October were much more coding focused, and my rambling blogs don&amp;rsquo;t compare favourably (in my mind) with the ultra-focused &amp;ldquo;learn this!&amp;rdquo; blogs that others stamp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s March and I committed to myself to keep daily blogging to June and I like to stick to my commitments.  I am getting a bit of coding done this week, following the WebSiteOne kick off with Michael and Raoul last Friday.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got three pull-requests open, one for each of the three tickets I committed to working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1564"&gt;spikes some example tooltips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1566"&gt;less intimidating invitations to scrums for non-logged in users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1568"&gt;adjust intial messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re all relatively simple view changes.  Most of the work so far has been fixing failing regression tests (i.e. other tests that were relying on the view looking a certain way).  Some of it is a bit spikey.  I&amp;rsquo;ve created acceptance tests in Cucumber for the last two, and the middle one above has some logic in the view that I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to pull out.  The blog from early Feb that I was reviewing last night also spiked something with a fair amount of code in the view.  Early February I was focused on getting the escalating call to action out, in the hope that it might impact the number of people upgrading to Premium plans, but as far as I can see it&amp;rsquo;s had no impact.  We&amp;rsquo;ve had a new Premium Mob member join, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s come entirely through Slack interaction.  Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a value in the long run with the name of the next upgrade being repeated to folks whenever they are coming to the site, but then again we&amp;rsquo;re not really tracking how often the different types of member view the home page &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1569"&gt;refactoring ticket&lt;/a&gt; to pull code out of the &amp;ldquo;escalating call to action&amp;rdquo; view.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard Armando say &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t put code in your views&amp;rdquo; umpteen times as I&amp;rsquo;ve re-viewed the MOOC videos. Clearly coding in ERB isn&amp;rsquo;t pretty - moving the code into a helper would reduce the number of symbols to look at.  It could go in a presenter, or be refactored into a model.  The code in the current feature I&amp;rsquo;m working on is less heinous.  That&amp;rsquo;s just the addition of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Want to learn more? Listen in. Next projects review meeting '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with the look and feel of the site, I find it easier just to be focusing on a single file.  The code in the escalating call for action view is more heinous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Basic'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium for additional support'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;membership_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Premium'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_subscription_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;plan: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'premiummob'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Upgrade to Premium Mob for group sessions with a Mentor'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_user_registration_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Get started now to begin coding!'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to pull the logic from either into the controller.  The code could be going into the Event or User models, but that feels like overloading them.  What we have here is sort of business logic about how we communicate with the different types of user.  Would it help to get the strings into the I18n setup so that we can refer to them via a constant string, the meaning of which can be looked up in a text file?  Or is that getting distracted from the business logic experiments we are trying to carry out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is refactoring these things for code cleanliness pulling time that could be spent on measuring their impact more accurately?  My temptation is to deploy the new language and see if the Scrum masters conclude that more new folks are coming into online hangouts.  That&amp;rsquo;s effectively what I&amp;rsquo;ve done for the &amp;ldquo;escalating call to action&amp;rdquo;.  I&amp;rsquo;m set up to be alerted whenever anyone signs up for a Premium plan and I&amp;rsquo;m in regular contact with all the Scrum masters.  Setting up extra code for measurement seems excessive at this stage.  I&amp;rsquo;m confused; what&amp;rsquo;s the distraction and what&amp;rsquo;s the focus? :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad we had this chat though - I&amp;rsquo;m thinking a presenter object is the way to go and that it might make the business logic clearer for the point when we want to focus on that without being distracted :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="feedback" src="/images/feedback.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got some great feedback from FutureLearn after I&amp;rsquo;d followed up to say how much I enjoyed their technical test and interview process (which included discussion and pair programming).  Here&amp;rsquo;s what they said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for coming in — I’m glad you enjoyed the process.  We really liked your technical skills, initiative and enthusiasm. You obviously have a lot of programming and agile experience, and have a lot to offer the team in terms of coaching, mentoring and supporting other developers. Ultimately we didn’t make you an offer because we had concerns about your communication skills. Your interviewers sometimes found it difficult to follow the conversation and get direct answers to the questions they asked; there was a general sense that your answers were sometimes circuitous or unclear, and that you didn’t express very much curiosity about what exactly the job would entail or what working at FutureLearn more generally would be like. In the end it was a very difficult decision given your high level of technical skill, but overall we felt it was unlikely to work out given the difficulties that your interviewers had in communicating comfortably with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to which I responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming back to me - that&amp;rsquo;s wonderful feedback, and I really appreciate you sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives me great food for thought, and I think the concern about communication is a valid one.  It&amp;rsquo;s something I definitely need to work on.  I tend to think out loud, and so going forward I&amp;rsquo;m going to try some experiments with different layers of filtering on how I respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards curiousity for what the job would entail and what working at FutureLearn would be like, I thought I was getting a really clear idea from the interview process itself.  Having taken courses on FutureLearn in the past, as well as having developed software and courses for edX as well as serving as a community manager for groups of edX instructors, everything I was hearing in the interview process gelled with how I imagined things would be, but it sounds like I could have worked harder to confirm my impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way I can certainly understand how a perceived lack of curiosity would impact your decision.  Thanks again for taking the time to interview me and sorry it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of luck with everything at FutureLearn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was disappointed not to have been made an offer, particularly since it would have helped address some of the financial concerns I have at the moment, and it would have been exciting to explore the codebase of the FutureLearn MOOC platform.  That said, I really am extraordinarily grateful for the extra feedback from FutureLearn.  In the absence of those specifics I might have imagined that the code that I wrote as part of the technical test, or something about my pair programming style might have been at fault.  However the concern about my communication skills in the technical interview fits in rather well with feedback and comments that I&amp;rsquo;ve got from other quarters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting question now is how to go about leveling up my communication skills. It sounds like it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to try a period where I spent additional time constructing answers before starting to speak.  It&amp;rsquo;s funny, there are so many online resources to help one learn to code, but level up your communication skills?  Well I googled for &amp;ldquo;improve your communication skills&amp;rdquo; and Google immediately highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5 Ways to Improve Your Communication Skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Never talk over people&lt;br&gt;
2) Don&amp;rsquo;t finish other people&amp;rsquo;s sentences&lt;br&gt;
3) Paraphrase&lt;br&gt;
4) Listen actively&lt;br&gt;
5) Maintain eye contact  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href="www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/improve-communication-skills.html"&gt;www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/improve-communication-skills.html&lt;/a&gt; which is fairly clear.  Maybe not too hard then :-)  Stay tuned to this blog to hear about the results of my attempt to level up my communication skills &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urgh, another mild cold :-( but a productive few days.  We had our new style WebSiteOne kick-off meeting on Friday following Michael&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that we re-start the meetings, but that we each bring up to three tickets that we care about; rather than just working through whichever tickets are in the backlog.  This approach came out of discussions around the AgileBookClub podcast, with an emphasis on focusing on the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; value associated with each ticket.  I chose the following tickets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1530"&gt;Add tooltips for &amp;ldquo;upgrade to mob&amp;rdquo; to explain and/or add info buttons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1555"&gt;Adjust initial messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1554"&gt;Adjusting how &amp;ldquo;next scrum&amp;rdquo; is displayed to new users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while Michael chose the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1560"&gt;Change call to action button verbiage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1487"&gt;Alternatives to google hangouts for pairing and scrums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1523"&gt;Convert Sign up links into big, orange buttons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we worked through each, writing new user-stories informed by our recent AgileBookClub podcast discussions.  Here are Michael&amp;rsquo;s tickets and the user stories we added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Convert Sign up links into big, orange buttons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;As an AgileVentures Admin
So that more people ultimately sign up for paid plans
I would like prominent buttons for sign up on the plan description pages
Whereas currently they are simply hyperlinks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternatives to google hangouts for pairing and scrums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;As AgileVentures Admin
So that we can analyze usage patterns and reflect teleconference participation in member profiles
I would like some mechanism of tracking teleconference participation 
Instead of the Google Hangouts API which is being removed in April

As AgileVentures Scrum master
So that I don't have to manually copy and paste teleconference details into other media
I would like some mechanism to alert potential participants that a teleconference is taking place (hangout and video stream)
Instead of the Google Hangouts API which is being removed in April
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change call to action button verbiage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;As an AgileVentures Admin
So that as many people as possible click through and sign up for membership and subscriptions
I want consistent and simple messaging on buttons (e.g. get started) that lead them to sign up/subscription pages
Instead of the current variation in messaging
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also voted on the tickets using Arreche&amp;rsquo;s new AsyncVoter system which worked really well, and we were very pleased to have Raoul join us.  We got through the 6 tickets in good time, and most of them, with the exception of the hangout API one, were one point stories.  Following what I had been hearing from Pat and his running of the WikiEduDashboard scrum/sprint I committed to completing my three tickets before another meeting the following Friday.  Michael committed to doing one of his, and I asked if he could investigate &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/av-static-website/issues/206"&gt;another ticket&lt;/a&gt; related to the static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been reading about the importance of these kind of commitments in Agile as part of research for a chapter on a book I&amp;rsquo;m writing on Agile methods in Open Source development.  According to Wikipedia, the Scrum methodology includes &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Values"&gt;five values&lt;/a&gt; which include &amp;ldquo;Commitment&amp;rdquo;, specifically that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been gradually sliding away from any formal sprint cycle on the projects I&amp;rsquo;m managing, as I get dispirited and demotivated by the difficulties I&amp;rsquo;ve faced trying to arrange regular meetings at times that everyone can attend.  I was also getting the sense that folks were not enthusiastic about such meetings, and so it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a breakthrough with Michael to discover that the problem was not necessarily the presence of a meeting, per se, but the structure of that meeting.  Michael&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm for the new structure is helping me feel more motivated for sprint cycle meetings.  I asked Michael at the end of the meeting on Friday if things had gone as he had hoped, if the discussion had been at the right level and he said yes, and so hopefully we can continue this format next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny - I&amp;rsquo;m just really happy to keep bashing away at tickets - happy with little structure, but I do notice that without a commitment to getting particular things done, all my different admin tasks can trump development work.  Maybe I do need a little more structure and commitment &amp;hellip; although trying to get people to make committments to doing things makes me feel strange.  In some ways I would rather they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t commit and then either or do, or not do.  In the absence of any committment there is no disappointment :-) Then again maybe making small structured committments is a framework and more folks will feel positive in the long run?  We&amp;rsquo;ll see :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="typing at keyboard" src="/images/coding.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I review and publish blogs from several months ago to medium, it&amp;rsquo;s clear I&amp;rsquo;m doing a lot less programming than I was.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing more charity admin and, I guess, &amp;ldquo;business development&amp;rdquo;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped pair programming regularly with Michael at least partly so that I can easily switch tasks through the day, but it is meaning that I won&amp;rsquo;t do a big chunk of coding unless I really clear space for it.  I am still reviewing a lot of code, looking at a lot of pull-requests, tech-tests, deploying code (devops?), running mob sessions and other bits and pieces.  I think the main things we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to achieve over the last year with the AgileVentures site is that it now looks better on mobile, the event creation process is more streamlined, and we have the Premium payment frameworks in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s reasonable progress, but it feels like we&amp;rsquo;ve plateaued in terms of income from Premium members, for the moment at least.  Official approval as a Charity has unlocked Google&amp;rsquo;s AdWords grant which has quadrupled traffic to our site, and is slowly pushing up our free members, but not leading directly to any increase in income so far.  We did land a small grant from the WikiMedia EDU group which is now paying for project management for the WikiEduDashboard project, which is a significant step forward in terms of sustainability, and that seemed to come almost directly from my appearing on the Ruby Rogues podcast.  We have corporate sponsorship from drie, but further collaboration with drie and the edX MOOC collaboration are both held up by negotiations between UCBerkeley and edX about technicalities related to the re-release of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all my effort reaching out to potential sponsors online I&amp;rsquo;ve generated nothing concrete outside of introductions through friends.  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to withdraw from all this online networking and focus on coding again?  The marketing team is looking like they are going to be perfectly capable of making great progress with just occasional input from me.  The first round of Premium signups came largely, I think, through me reaching out to people via email.  Alot of the upgrades have come through me reaching out to folks on Slack.  The things blocking the marketing team are coding and infrastructure issues, so me coding is probably going to be the thing that helps the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to write a book and start a podcast as long term &amp;ldquo;lead generation&amp;rdquo;, but I feel like it might be time for a coding binge &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is full of apprenticeship, eating, walking, talking, dealing with our social environment, reading, writing, counting, programming. We have learnt, discovered or invented anything we do. Pedagogy is everywhere and everybody is a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is both a trainee and a trainer, if learning is so common and widespread, why is pedagogy so controversial?  Probably because learning is vital.  Moreover, because we think that the way we think, the way we grasp our environment and the world strongly depends on the way we have learnt and what we know. Knowledge is power and many people in the Valley could sing &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got the Power, I&amp;rsquo;ve got your Data, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna mimic your Brain, you&amp;rsquo;ll be another clone of my computers :-)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TMTOWTDI, training, learning, teaching, educating, discovering, inventing are a few verbs that describe very different ways to learn. A coach differs from a trainer, a trainer from a teacher. A school is not a research lab&amp;hellip; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may learn to do, to perform, to make, to build, to design, to invent or to understand, you may even learn to learn, and learn to teach. And learning is not confined to human beings.  Animals learn too.  And your computer will soon begin to learn too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many lessons out of computers learning, possibly because computer scientists try to mimic the way we learn : program (acquire knowledge), test (assess and improve), supervised (mimetic), unsupervised (exploratory), reinforcement (learn by doing).  But there are some caveats too.  Take reinforcement learning.  The computer is &amp;ldquo;punished&amp;rdquo; for wrong answers and &amp;ldquo;rewarded&amp;rdquo; for good answers.  Have you ever seen a computer sulking a a corner?  It&amp;rsquo;s a grim perspective.  I hope that, in the future, a global initiative will ban computer bullying.  Well, computers are things.  They don&amp;rsquo;t care about bullying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent article in ACM Communications magazine, that traces the intellectual itinerary of JH.Holland, gives me a better hint.  Learning is all about exploration, selection and exploitation.  No more punishing, we exploit things our ancesters tested.  We explore new things.  We select things that work and forget things that don&amp;rsquo;t - well, we may store it somewhere to prevent us from trying again. After all, learning consists in forgetting your failures and magnifying your successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, forgetting is not easy.  My hobby includes restoring wooden boats.  In shipyards, apprentices learn by doing.  Doing is a great word for tidying up the shopfloor, gathering tools, sweeping sawdust.  So why does the yard master punish apprentices before they try and fail?  In a shipyard, you will find no version control system, no revert button, no rollback procedure and no backup and restoration tools.  People do their best to prevent wrong cuts in expensive wood.  And people do their best too to prevent injuries while working in a hazardous environment.  Participating in peripheral tasks is a great way to accustom with the shop and to grasp the big picture of the trade.  You gain confidence, trust and responsibilities as you get involved in the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sweeping is not your cup of tea, I may suggest you alternatives.  The first one is to learn the hard way by establishing your own shop.  As long as you pay for the wood, you are free to cut.  I followed this path and I definitely end up sweeping my own sawdust. Achievments are (sometimes) very rewarding &amp;hellip; and failures are quite punishing.  The second one is to read Richard Feynman&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;the pleasure of finding things out&amp;rdquo;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t try to mislead you.  Richard Feynman was probably a very hard worker and a very demanding teacher.  But he put the stress on what really matters : the freedom to explore, and the wonder that we feel for sciences and natural world are more important than a few bad cuts in an oak timber.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The final part of the FutureLearn interview was a chat with a client specialist and front end developer, with questions about my experiences in teams and working with clients.  I enjoyed the conversation, and it allowed me to articulate something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking over and over again and still have trouble putting into practice.  It&amp;rsquo;s this process of avoiding blocking people, and what to do instead.  I use the term blocking to mean disagreeing, correcting grammar/pronunciation, ignoring suggestions.  A whole range of things.  Now sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s important to block.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think one should never block, but that blocking always come with a cost.  Generally when people are speaking they are trying to get something across, some idea or opinion or what have you.  Maybe some enlightened folks are really not bothered to be blocked, but many of us, if we are making the effort to say something, would probably prefer to be allowed to fully express our thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might relish being blocked in that they enjoy a heated argument, and all power to them; but the danger is that the heated discussion that two people are enjoying (at some level) is not much fun for other people who are present at the same time.  Anyway, so one of the FutureLearn folks asked me &amp;ldquo;so you don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say you should never disagree with anything?&amp;rdquo;, and I replied that I almost did.  Not that I&amp;rsquo;ve been much good at this, but the process for deciding whether to bring up a block should include some consideration of the number of people involved.  Are you talking one on one, or is this a group meeting with 15?  Also, how important is it really?  Is the building on fire and if people don&amp;rsquo;t stop talking and leave now they&amp;rsquo;re all going to die?  Also, are you in a position of some seniority and tasked with, or simply feel responsible for, helping a group or individual feel good about at least some aspects of what they are doing, and empowered to take on challenges; learn from their own mistakes etc.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s my academic background, but my tendency for a long time has been to treat any problem like a mathematical or logical statement.  It&amp;rsquo;s as if people are coming up to me and saying &amp;ldquo;2+2=4&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;go on &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, or they&amp;rsquo;re saying &amp;ldquo;1+1=3&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;actually I think you mean &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, with little consideration for anything other than my perception of the logical coherence of what they&amp;rsquo;re saying.  The clear problem with this approach is that my mental model of the world is just that, mine.  I have no monopoly on logically coherent views of the universe, and indeed how important is logical coherence anyway?  Furthermore I&amp;rsquo;m not usually thinking about how people might feel about being blocked.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I am slowly getting better at this, but who knows? :-) What I&amp;rsquo;m starting to come round to thinking is that, in the majority of situations, how people feel is far more important than whether what they are saying is objectively correct or not.  Of course this should naturally follow from my own basic assumption that there is no objective correctness.  I belive everything is subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own sense that everything is subjective should in principle prepare me for the great differences between people&amp;rsquo;s mental models of the world.  The faulty assumption on my part seems to be that the majority of people are interested in investing time in getting to the bottom of these differences.  I really enjoy pulling apart what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about to try and work out what assumptions I&amp;rsquo;m working on; debating the relative merits of different approaches, but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of an outlier there, maybe &amp;hellip; or maybe that all depends on who I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with on a particular week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, Ruben at Makers Academy recommmended to me that it&amp;rsquo;s better to ask questions than contradict people, and I laugh at myself for how difficult this seems to be for me to do.  Recently however, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reformulating in my head that the key thing is questioning rather than asserting.  As I said to the FutureLearn people, it&amp;rsquo;s all about assessing how important your own concern is, and then working out whether it&amp;rsquo;s actually important to make a block.  If someone is trying to convince your friend to jump off a cliff, perhaps it is critical to jump in with a block, but even then perhaps a question about consequences is better?  And is it vital that the question is now in front of the group, or is it better to ask the question one on one?  My new resolution is stop making assertions, ask more questions and prefer to ask those questions to the smallest subset of people possible &amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes :-)&lt;/p&gt;
