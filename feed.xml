    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wednesday saw me firing off a few emails to potential sponsors, which felt like a good start, since landing another sponsor would make all the difference to us over the coming months.  We had our second mob programming session, and I got a preview copy of the new RSpec book, so things were humming along.  What wasn&amp;rsquo;t humming along was invites to Slack.  We still seemed to be having an email every day or two saying that the automated Slack invite was not showing up after a sign up on the main AV site.  Michael and I had put in an email system to supposedly alert us when the Slack invites failed, as they sometimes did when the API key expired.  Those email alerts had only ever triggered for failures on the develop system.  And looking back through the logs it seemed that invites really weren&amp;rsquo;t going out for the last month or so and our fail-safe wasn&amp;rsquo;t even triggering; so frustrating!  The challenge with this kind of issue is that every time someone says they didn&amp;rsquo;t receive the invite, it could be because of a spam filter issue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do get cc&amp;rsquo;d all the welcome emails when people join AV so I can see the flow of people coming in.  I just wish I could get cc&amp;rsquo;d on the Slack invite emails.  I&amp;rsquo;d refreshed the API keys recently.  The Slack invite thing would clearly require another detailed look. Doubly frustrating was the hacked up env settings for test that meant the full Slack invite pathway was not properly tested.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dive into debugging the Slack issue as I was feeling the AsyncVoter project was blocked due to a lack of test harness on the AsyncSlack bot; so I took a temporary measure and grabbed the emails for the most recently signed up 150 AV members and did a bulk invite in Slack.  It told me that at least 80 people had never been invited.  It was gratifying to see the 15 or so new members enter slack over the next 12 hours with several of them mentioning the Ruby Rogues podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having put in the short term fix I could focus a couple of hours coding on getting a test harness into the AsyncSlackBot.  I refactored the simple unit test from the day before so the naming of the files and methods was more consistent, and started on checking out the BotMock project.  Installing it involved building it locally and copying over a couple of mock files.  Not ideal, and I start to think we could just as quickly build our own mocking system, as we did in the agile-bot project.  The BotMock project is new and not even on npm, and I wonder if we&amp;rsquo;re really gaining much from it.  I stamped out a few controller tests using their approach, which involved coding in ES6 and I had to adjust the callback operations to get working tests like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should acknowledge vote if users direct messages `vote #`'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'vote 1'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"I received your vote: 1 &amp;lt;@test&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usersInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with this sort of test had involved pulling the body of the bot out of the server.js file and dropping it into a controller file from which it would be exported.  I was getting critical practice with breaking up my node apps.  Not that it&amp;rsquo;s so hard, but when something is slighltly less familiar it&amp;rsquo;s easy to put off doing it.  I ended up with a pull request that did a bit of testing on each of the canned bot responses, but didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve a full test of the full voting sequence as it was unclear how to check a series of interactions.  The BotMock had some example conversation tests, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t working for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good start over the initial spike, but it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating that the high level character of the app can&amp;rsquo;t easily be read from the mocha tests, in the same way that it can be difficult to read them in RSpec.  Both Mocha and RSpec can give verbose test output that provides a nice summary of what&amp;rsquo;s going on like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  controller tests
    ✓ should return `help message` if user types `help` (208ms)
    ✓ should return `hello yourself` if user types `hello` (204ms)
    ✓ should return vote announcement if user types `start new vote` (202ms)
    ✓ should acknowledge vote if users direct messages `vote #` (208ms)
    ✓ should return results if users types `results` (205ms)
    - should summarise results after a vote

  Bot
    Controller
      ✓ should receive message

  summary_text
    ✓ should format vote text correctly for no votes


  7 passing (1s)
  1 pending
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I personally find it difficult to digest that output.  What I mean is that when I&amp;rsquo;m working on the code, usually with the spec on one half of the screen and the app code on the other half like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="code layout" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vkcavhglz2kkadq/Screenshot%202016-12-02%2009.59.23.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;most of the mocha/rspec code is taken up with boilerplate that is specific to the testing framework and not the app itself.  The high level English language description is scattered in comments.  I really do love Cucumber for giving me that description in the editor and not in the separate terminal output.  So perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time to try out Yada (cucumber nodejs alternative) in this project, but I think I can&amp;rsquo;t get too sucked in to testing frameworks without pushing more functionality to actually help automate me away from tedious admin tasks.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is exciting is that it seems that if we feed the bot an API token rather than a bot token, we can get the bot to behave as me (as Thomas and I found testing another bot).  So potentially I can augment myself on Slack directly.  Dangerous perhaps; in a test with Arreche I already tripped an infinite loop in a private channel.  Lots of testing required to avoid more mishaps like that :-)  I got the PR in and managed a separate flurry of coding/devops on ProjectScope later in the evening.  The new month meant my Heroku quotas had been reset and so I could get this overview of how the different AV projects were proceeding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Project metrics on AV projects" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/emvw7cujo777itx/Screenshot%202016-12-01%2018.41.42.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics are interactive and when you mouse over them you get some explanations and pop-ups of who&amp;rsquo;s got what level of activity in Slack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="showing who's active in slack" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/assku0q6ptxhp7r/Screenshot%202016-12-01%2018.52.19.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this really is the way forward; automation of project management via Slack bot and breaking our monolith into microservices, e.g. metrics on all the projects in one service, manangement of hangouts/events in another service; so that we can grow to more and more projects supported, in following Agile principles to keep them all delivering value to the end users and the individual team members participating in order to level up in the chosen skill sets.  Can we get into that sweet spot where all the effort and automation and reflection results in a great user experience all round without overwhelming the support staff?  Stay tuned to this blog to find out!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was a day of much task switching.  It started with putting my office back together after new windows had been put in.  That took a while.  I managed to quickly stamp out a blog on the Agile Project Workshop before the &amp;ldquo;Martin Fowler&amp;rdquo; scrum.  My attempts at changing the flow for blog drafts were getting a little out of hand as the process of squashing and merging between the &lt;code&gt;new_blog_drafts&lt;/code&gt; branch and master seemed to be leaving stray commits that were then making the subsequent new blog draft PRs rather messy.  In frustration I deleted the branch and re-created it.  I think we need to go with Arreche&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of a webhook, and to do that I&amp;rsquo;ll need to move the blog_draft notifications into the new AV Premium Slack instance; or at least some where with spare Slack integration capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scrum I was advising one Premium member about the perils of task switching, or more accurately about the perils of spreading oneself too thin over many projects.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! :-)  After the scrum I joined Matt for an hour pairing on WebSiteOne and Redeemify, and I managed to restrain myself from immediately diving in to individual problems and talked to Matt about the bigger picture of trying to make progress with all of AgileVentures and WebsiteOne in particular.  We reviewed the open PRs and board and I unblocked Matt on two issues, and then helped him with another on Redeemify where the presence of a legacy Rails 3 &lt;code&gt;asset&lt;/code&gt; group in the Gemfile was breaking the system on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I scaffolded a mentoring session for a private company on a paid project.  I used google hangouts to connect up an experienced developer from the US with a London based educational company, so they could get advice on their legacy Rails codebase.  That all seemed to go reasonably well, and more sessions like those could go a long way to making my own financial situation a lot more stable.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see if we can&amp;rsquo;t do a lot more of that.  I had been hoping to bring in some large paid projects for the benefit of a group of AV Premium members, but maybe slivers of small consulting work will ultimately serve the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was monitoring the paid session I was managing Slack and getting my own company&amp;rsquo;s corporation tax paid.  30 minutes on the phone to discover that Her Majesties Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) aren&amp;rsquo;t sending paper letters with reference ids any more. Next I caught up with Thomas and Michael in the &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck&amp;rdquo; scrum, and we talked more about the task switching issue.  Michael called out Thomas and myself as being heavy task switchers, and we clarified that although there was lots of room for us to be more task focused, heavy task switching can be particularly challenging for junior developers.  While there&amp;rsquo;s lots to learn from different projects, Thomas and I agreed that sticking with one codebase for a couple of weeks to really get to know it well is important for someone just learning the ropes.  Actually I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I&amp;rsquo;d really like to have a coding binge on a single project.  I&amp;rsquo;ve started looking at the calender to see when I will get to the one year mark for my blogs.  Blogging every day is great, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking wistfully about other setups, for example where I do nothing but code for four days and then do blogging and admin on a Friday &amp;hellip;  I wonder if my commitments to help people get coordinated on Slack prevent me from getting any really focused coding done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it was June when I started blogging daily.  Will I keep myself to my committment of doing it every day for a year?  That&amp;rsquo;s another six months &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m also wondering if I can do a blog that&amp;rsquo;s almost purely code?  Personal time management strategy aside I jumped into a quick session with Michael.  I was totally torn between working on the Premium upgrade interface on WSO and the slack bot.  It certainly feels like the async slack bot could be a real engine of activity for many projects.  What I&amp;rsquo;m really hoping is that it can start to partly take over some of the project managment admin roles that I&amp;rsquo;m doing on various projects.  I&amp;rsquo;d also love it to take over some of the greeting and orienting admin.  Of course it might all backfire if all the projects get really active and my workload spikes! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not measuring quantiatively, but from the Slack messages pinging about, I get the sense we have more active projects now in AgileVentures than ever before.  I resolved to try and get some testing code into the async Slack bot spike to give us a framework going forward.  This was the repping on node testing setup I&amp;rsquo;d been talking about needing to do for some time.  I followed the mocha docs to produce this test with Michael and Arreche&amp;rsquo;s input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var assert &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; require&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'assert'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
var vote_text &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; require&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'../src/utils'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;

describe&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Server'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  describe&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'vote_text'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    it&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'should format vote text correctly for no votes'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
      assert.equal&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;vote_text&lt;span class="o"&gt;([])&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'0 vote so far []'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the contents of the utils file under test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;votes&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  var text &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; votes.length +&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' vote'&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;votes.length &amp;gt; 1&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    text +&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'s'&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  text +&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' so far ['&lt;/span&gt;
  votes.forEach&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;vote&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     text +&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;@'&lt;/span&gt; + vote.user + &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;gt; '&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;;
  text +&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;']'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return &lt;/span&gt;text;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a spike of a unit testing setup.  I had to run off to take my sons to football academy and so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to fix up the awful naming conventions in the above.  Do we really want a &lt;code&gt;utils&lt;/code&gt; file, or should we be creating a &lt;code&gt;vote_text&lt;/code&gt; function in the utils file, or should we be creating objects?  Michael pointed out that as the Slack bot, this code would have a different domain from the RESTful API we had built separately, revolving more around channels and users than votes and stories.  We left it on the note of could we get a good end-to-end acceptance testing framework in there.  My experiences with testing Stripe have soured me a little to sandboxing systems like VCR, and our attempt to use the node equivalent of sepia on the AgileBot project had been met with failure.  I found a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gratifychat/BotMock"&gt;BotMock&lt;/a&gt; framework that would in principle allow us to do to botkit what we had done with the Stripe Ruby mock on WebsiteOne.  BotKit really had been a gorgeous experience in terms of getting the spike of the bot up and running.  What I wanted now most of all was a good way to get the high level user stories of the slack bot defined and driving the code.  At the moment they live implicitly in the spiked code and some Slack interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The needle we really want to thread is the one that allows us to expose clearly the features that the system supports, so that we don&amp;rsquo;t get all snarled as we add new features and evolve the domain model; and that new developers coming onto the project can easily orient themselves.  What we don&amp;rsquo;t want is to get bogged down in crazy bugs arising from mis-matches between our mental models of the software and testing components.  If we can thread that needle, perhaps we can support many active projects without my brain being levered out of my ears, and possibly enough space for a coding binge without too much task switching.  Now that would be a great Christmas present! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of Tuesday was taken up with running a workshop on Agile Project Development for non-profits at the Volunteer Services Center up the road.  This was for Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative (VAHC), who are the client for the Harrow Community Network site, which uses the LocalSupport software.  Here was the description of the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach to project management, Agile Project Management, attempts to create a different model.
&amp;ldquo;Most nonprofits are interested in process improvements that will better enable them to accomplish their respective missions. However, major change can be intimidating and complicated to implement, especially if the organisation isn’t quite sure what it needs to do differently or lacks the expertise to make it happen across the organisation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agile project management approach aims to address the needs of those working in a project-focused environment who want to be agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will provide an insight into how you can effectively instigate Agile project management into your nonprofit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Agile is and where it came from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Agile Manifesto, principles and practises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of Agile to your nonprofit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing Agile in your nonprofit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication, collaboration and culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk management and pitfalls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technologies to help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will leave the course having gone through a small scale Agile process learning first hand how it can be implemented into your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trainer: Agile Ventures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost (Per Person):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free - Harrow Voluntary, Community &amp;amp; Social Enterprise Sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£30 - Voluntary, Community &amp;amp; Social Enterprise Sector (Not working or based in Harrow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£40 - Public &amp;amp; Private Sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were eight attendees from different charity groups based in Harrow and some of the adjoining boroughs.  Including Alex and myself that made 10 which worked pretty well I think.  We&amp;rsquo;d done a &lt;a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2016/11/21/agile-workshop/"&gt;dry run of the event&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks back with the VAHC staff in a group of six including myself.  That dry run had followed this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro &amp;ldquo;What is Agile? How this workshop will run&amp;rdquo; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kickoff&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; generate a series of stories about what to do in the workshop, e.g. &amp;ldquo;How do we motivate people?  What&amp;rsquo;s a scrum?&amp;rdquo; write on cards, arrange on whiteboard &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BREAK &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Voting&amp;rdquo; on stories &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; identify common stories and vote on their difficulty, work out their priority &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go into small teams each working on a different story &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BREAK &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small teams each presenting their work on their story &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Retrospective&amp;rdquo; looking back over the process and how it could be improved &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excluding breaks, that was 6 ten minute chunks; running for an hour.  The full workshop followed the same model but each chunk lasted 25 minutes.  The key things I&amp;rsquo;d learned from the dry run were: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to bring a mac VGA connector to use the projector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sprint diagram would be helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We might need a way to intro people&amp;rsquo;s names &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be good to arrange all the tickets onto a kanban board on the wall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d need better pens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Agile process to understand the Agile process might be confusing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the simple logistical issues sorted, and started the main workshop by having the eight attendees do pairwise introductions.  I started the workshop as before by explaining the six part structure of the workshop and added the new element of emphasizing the workshop objective &amp;ldquo;To understand Agile Project Management&amp;rdquo;.  I tried to highlight how ultimately the Agile processs could be applied to any project, but that our project in the three hour workshop was &amp;ldquo;To understand Agile Project Management&amp;rdquo; and we would be compressing what might be done in an 2 week sprint into those three hours.  I talked briefly about the background of Agile, and how it derives from the &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Software Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around I also showed an image representing a sprint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scrum overiew" src="http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/methods/scrum/scrum-overview.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then we got into the process of starting to generate stories.  This time around I didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute any stories myself but with 9 others writing away we quickly had loads to work with.  I lead the process of trying to organise the stories into themes.  The stories were pretty much all questions.  I guess in a future workshop I could ask for all the stories to be in the stakeholder, objective, desire format, but things seemed to go okay without it.  We went through a process of consolidation and generated five &amp;ldquo;epics&amp;rdquo;, which we voted on, giving us the following set of ready items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile affect funding and reporting to funders? (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile handle financial planning and management (3 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile handle conflict (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Agile planning cope with changing timeframes (1 point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the Pros &amp;amp; Cons of Agile vs other methodologies (2 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which we prioritised and then worked on each of the first three in separate three teams of three, with me moving between the teams to give help and support.  The really interesting things to come out of the process was to see the attendees answering their own questions and inferring, from the overall Agile process that we were using, how Agile might work for them.  As usual the voting and voting discussion was a critical learning period as we distinguished what we were voting on (complexity/ambiguity rather than priority or delegation), and I think the attendees were getting insights into how just having that discussion could help surface and resolve conflicts.  While the teams were working I got their tickets up on a makeshift Kanban layout on the wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="kanban layout on wall of meeting room" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tp01dj0jtxdwvfy/non-proft-kanban.jpg?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams presented their findings to each other and I saw the time had run away with us.  There was only five minutes left for the retrospective.  This was a shame since as I was at pains to point out that all the other mechanics of scrums, sprints, standups, Kanban charts etc. were all optional aspects of Agile, and the key element that made a process Agile was reflection on how different aspects of the process were working.  We did a quick retro going round the table with each person saying briefly what had been positive and what could be improved on about the workshop.  Not ideal since those going first would bias those talking after, but the general theme was that the attendees had found actually working through the Agile process very informative; although many of them would like more specific examples about usage of the techniques in the non-profit sector.  There was also interest in a more advanced workshop and I mentioned Alex&amp;rsquo;s and my idea about a 2 day workshop, with the 2 days being separated by 2 weeks, and effectively running an inception/kick-off and retrospective for an organisation.  It would certainly be interesting to run something like that although Alex was skeptical about people coming back for the second day 2 weeks later.  I think if people were paying for it that might make all the difference :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great experience, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be very interested to hear what people say in the privacy of the feedback forms.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;d want to spend every day doing workshops like this, but it was great to be meeting all these hard-working charity/non-profit folks, and what I&amp;rsquo;d really love to be doing is more implementation of Agile methods in their organisations to see if we could really help them improve their outcomes.  Perhaps this will be a stepping stone to that &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The slackbot had stayed live for most of the weekend on drie push, but on Monday morning it was unresponsive, and although we&amp;rsquo;d completed a vote or two, not all the notifications had come through.  The bot would not restart from fresh pushes of code.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it back online without ssh-ing in and starting it directly.  drie push is not explicitly designed for hosting slack bots, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any functionality to put the bot into a background job that would persist after logging out of ssh.  Actually I&amp;rsquo;d been surprised that the slack bot had worked on drie push at all; I&amp;rsquo;d pushed it up there as an experiment and seen that it worked partially, but now we needed a more consistent hosting solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;d shown the #websiteone channel the promise of a bot that could run an asynchronous vote, there was less appetite for starting manual ones, and not having the stable hosted bot was starting to feel like a blocker.  Slack has a &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/hosting"&gt;page dedicated to different bot hosting solutions&lt;/a&gt;. In parallel with chatting on Slack with the team about the options, I spent a little while looking at what AWS Lambda had to offer, and then Matt suggested that BeepBoop looked like it had a great free offering.  I signed up for a BeepBoop account and got through most of pulling our repo asyncbot directly into beepboop, but then it was failing due to lack of a DockerFile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;unable to prepare context: Cannot locate Dockerfile: absDockerfile: "/tmp/b54c5a30aa584533b027af837beeef64683410820/repo/Dockerfile"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was probably a simple solution, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure.  I felt like I could have this bot up and running on AWS pretty quickly and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be beholden to some other service that was going to start squeezing me on price like Heroku has been doing recently.  The only reason I hadn&amp;rsquo;t immediately spun up an AWS instance was that whenever I tried to go to the AWS console in Chrome it was auto-switching to the saasbook team account, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create some instance that Armando would start paying for.  I went to Safari (I know there are chrome profiles) and created a new AgileVentures AWS account and created a free-tier eligible tiny Ubuntu instance and had that up in a matter of minutes.  In the meantime Arreche was telling me he could get the planning poker script up in hubot pretty fast, but I really wanted to see how far I could get with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up the ssh config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# ~/.ssh/config

Host AsyncVoterBot
HostName ec2-54-999-999-999.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
User ubuntu
IdentityFile "~/.ssh/SuperSecretKey.pem"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to make it super easy to log into the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ssh AsyncVoterBot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I installed git, nodejs and npm using &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; (although I burned some time mistakenly installing &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and then trying to build node from source) before cloning our async slack bot project, setting the slack bot token in the environment and running the bot in a tmux session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tmux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# in tmux environment
$ nodejs server.js &amp;amp;
# Ctrl-B D to detach
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tmux attach # to get back in
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was imagining I would have to do some security configuration to get it all to work, but no such thing.  The bot was live, and I ran some test votes in a private channel.  I had the tmux session (just as we have on the autograders) so that the bot can stay live and running even after I log out of the machine, and I checked that the bot stayed live over a few ins and outs.  It&amp;rsquo;s still running today, and although my attempts to ssh into it appear to be &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#TroubleshootingInstancesConnectionTimeout"&gt;timing out&lt;/a&gt;, I assume that&amp;rsquo;s a temporary AWS issue (fixed with adding an inbound rule for my new IP).  There&amp;rsquo;s no cost for the bot so far, but that will be the real question, how much does this cost us?  I was able to link the new AgileVentures AWS account to the new AgileVentures bank account.  I sort of assume that this will come in less than the $7 a month that Heroku want for an always-on instance, but let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is the right overall approach, but I was pleased to get something up on AWS that has a chance of being an affordable solution, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty confident in my ability to manage AWS boxes given my experience with the autograders.  We managed two or three bot scaffolded votes on #websiteone and there were others to do in parallel in #async_voter so I did a manual one there which pushes us towards new features like supporting multiple votes in parallel, and getting a test harness round this hacky botkit code.  More voting and coding to be done!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friday was full of meetings.  I started off heading down to the &lt;a href="https://www.harrowcn.org.uk/organisations/carramea-community-resource"&gt;Carramea Community Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Consortium of Anti-Racist Refugee and Minority-Ethnic Associations). Carramea has been operating in South Harrow for over 12 years, and provides affordable office solutions for small charities and voluntary groups; as well as IT and Language classes.  I&amp;rsquo;d met the head honcho Tony O&amp;#39;Hara at local WoodCraft and other charity events, and that morning Rachel from Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative was running a training session to show some of the staff how to work with Harrow Community Network (HCN), Do-It and SurveyMonkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there to observe and took notes as Rachel guided three staff through the mechanisms to update directory information in HCN, and to post volunteer opportunities.  Tony dropped in and out as he covered the reception desk while the training session was underway.  Rachel then went on to show how to post opportunities on Do-It and give pro-tips.  Carramea already had an opportunity up on Do-It (for volunteer receptionists) and it was already showing in our system, having been pulled in automatically from the Do-It database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Carramea volunteer opportunity on HCN" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/aa2o2g87b23z98p/Screenshot%202016-11-28%2009.42.00.png?dl=1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have been projecting, but it seemed clear that there was not much incentive for the Carramea staff to add volunteer opportunities directly through our interface unless it would also post them to Do-It.  And even then, it would probably take a superlative user experience, and posting to other sites such as TeamLondon and ReachSkills in order for it to be worth their while.  This sort of system does seem to be Rachel&amp;rsquo;s vision for Harrow Community Network going forward.  No one wants to be entering the same information over and over, and if we can create a seamless experience that allows posting to multiple volunteer sites we really might start to see usage of the HCN site go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rachel went on to train the staff on SurveyMonkey one of the main things that seemed to be causing a drag was password management, and at the end when asked, I suggested that perhaps 1password or LastPass might be something that the Carramea might like to try internally.   It had been great to see a local charity being shown the HCN site.  As a training session we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see usability problems that might come up when the staff use it independently, but that pushes me to get better at monitoring and interpreting the site usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I dashed back to my home office to get the days blog up, try out a new process of editing blogs directly on GitHub and do pull requests from a branch to auto notify the #blog_drafts channel, then lunch and a Premium Plus pairing on P vs NP and classic problems like Travelling Salesman, Knapsack and 3-SAT.  I must dig out the paper I wrote on 3-Sat &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much chance to reflect though, I was immediately off to another local charity event.  Rachel had suggested I come along to the Youth First event, an initiative being funded by Harrow Council through the &lt;a href="https://youngharrowfoundation.org"&gt;Young Harrow Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to center around creating a platform for Youth services, resources and opportunities in Harrow.  In particular an app which young people could use on their phones to find out about activities and resources local to them in the hope that this would help those who might otherwise fall in with gangs or fall out of the system due to challenges such as mental health problems.  I got there early and did a quick on-location &amp;ldquo;Kent Beck Scrum&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event itself there were moving speeches by a former gang member, and another youth who&amp;rsquo;d faced mental health challenges, about the paths they&amp;rsquo;d ended up taking and how they&amp;rsquo;d turned things around.  There was enthusiastic applause for both, and I was particularly struck by the former gang member who&amp;rsquo;d turned to crime to get money to pay for things like going to football training.  I&amp;rsquo;m coach of an under eight soccer team, and it makes me think about ways in which we can make things more affordable for disadvantaged youths and their families.  I also met Lynne who works with former gang members and told me there are free football sessions being run in Harrow, so there&amp;rsquo;s definitely room for connecting young people with the resources available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was concern voiced at the event about the longevity of the project.  Apparently a well-intentioned website had previously tried to do something similar in the past, but had fallen by the wayside.  We heard that the council had already selected an IT firm to deliver on the project for the next five years, but I worry that this will go the way of similar large projects where the feedback from the community and end-users do not reach the developers.  Or does not reach them quickly enough to have an impact.  Clearly disadvantaged youths are not going to always have cellphones, but care-worker and other support folks will, and in round table discussions we talked about how just having that information to hand could be very useful.  At the same time it&amp;rsquo;s another dangerous &amp;ldquo;technology to the rescue&amp;rdquo; setup.  Another member of the round table pointed out that even with the information about what&amp;rsquo;s available locally there&amp;rsquo;s actually getting individuals to the take the step towards attending events, and reaching out for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly it occurred to me on the way home that part of the challenge is the increasing population in Harrow, with many single family occupancy houses being turned into bedsits for 5 or 6, and the building of low-rise flats in almost every available free space.  Harrow might seem to be a privileged borough in North West London, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without its problems.  The Youth Offer event was taking place the day after a &lt;a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/student-stabbed-outside-south-harrow-tube-station-loses-fight-for-life-a3403541.html"&gt;19 year old died&lt;/a&gt; from an apparently unprovoked knife attack outside South Harrow tube station, just down the road from the Carremea offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a packed day, but great to see the connection between our work and members of the community.  The difficulty with being charity and non-profit focused is that money is scarce, and everything&amp;rsquo;s being run on a shoestring.  And let&amp;rsquo;s not fool ourselves that we&amp;rsquo;ll have a positive impact by throwing technology at the problem; let&amp;rsquo;s keep everything on the table and try to have an impact first and foremost and worry about which tools and technology we use second.  That said these are projects that you can really put your heart and soul into, because they are fighting to make a positive difference in people&amp;rsquo;s lives, not just fighting to make a buck.  If you believe there&amp;rsquo;s more to life than money then come join us and put your heart and soul into projects that can make a difference worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We ran our first AV Premium Mob Programming session looking at code from the book &amp;ldquo;Confident Ruby&amp;rdquo; by Avdi Grimm.  We created a Cloud9 workspace and gave everyone access to the enviroment.   We had four Premium members join the hangout, and I introduced some of the concepts from &amp;ldquo;Confident Ruby&amp;rdquo; before playing with some of the code samples.  All the members in the hangout had read and write access to the Cloud9 workspace, but on this first occasion I did most of the typing.  Most of the members had Avdi&amp;rsquo;s book or had been listening to the Ruby Book Club podcasts that cover it, but it was the first time mob programming for all of them, and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll get them doing more typing in future sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focused on Avdi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Use built-in conversion protocols&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Collecting Input&lt;/em&gt; pattern with chats about the use of Structs in Ruby, monkey patching (duck punching), duck typing and whether the implicit and explicit conversion operators (e.g. &lt;code&gt;to_int&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;to_i&lt;/code&gt;) should be more actively documented in the Ruby core classes.  I also touched on the concept of &amp;ldquo;Power Level&amp;rdquo; in response to the question of when to use Structs vs using Classes.  In my experience Structs are an often over-looked aspect of Ruby that allow a developer to create a data structure that has less power than a full blown class.  In parallel with the security guideline that you should only ever provide the minimum level of access necessary to get a job done, there&amp;rsquo;s a similar argument to say that you should only ever use the minimally flexible data structure or entity in order to acheive a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility sounds great, but it actually equates with complexity.  More powerful entities can do more things, and they are more complex to interact with as a result.  I often write out a simplified power sequence for Ruby as follows from low power to high power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boolean ( true/false )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;struct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive over simplification as the functionality of each of these entities varies along many different dimensions.  However in general we should prefer to use, say, a boolean (true/false) to represent something that has two possible values (e.g. receive email updates preference), rather than using a String to store the values &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo;.  The Struct in Avdi&amp;rsquo;s example looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:prize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"first"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Peasant's Quest game"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"second"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Limozeen Album"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;third&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Place&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"third"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Butter-da"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although he could have used hashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"first"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Peasant's Quest game"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"second"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Limozeen Album"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;third&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;index: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"third"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;prize: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Butter-da"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hash is more flexible. We can add arbitrary additional key/value pairs to the individual hash objects, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That flexibility is extra power, that maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t need at this stage.  You can argue we might need it later, but the hashes are also rather unDRY in that the key names have to be repeated over and over, and if we need an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; key we can add it to the Struct, which is arguably DRYer than the long form hashes.  The Struct also provides us a nicer syntax for accessing its key/value contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pros and cons to both approaches.  DRYing out the keys into the Struct means that we have increased the dependency between the three entities, so that if we add an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; to the Struct, all the instances of the Struct will also sprout an &lt;code&gt;:amount&lt;/code&gt; key.  Maybe we want that and maybe we don&amp;rsquo;t; it all depends on the domain model and the behaviours we are trying to support.  Ruby Structs and Hashes differ in various ways, and the real challenge when choosing one over the other is getting the right match, from the various features of Struct and Hash, to the problem we are trying to solve.  It&amp;rsquo;s also sensible to avoid agonising and choose whatever seems simplest to start with and then change to more powerful or complex entities as the required behaviour starts to generate pain points in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback from the mob session was positive, and we had great suggestions for more group problem solving in the future to get everyone&amp;rsquo;s fingers dirty with the code.  It was a good day, and after lunch I started knocking off the automation tasks identified from the previous couple of days profiling.  I started by pushing the slack bot code onto &lt;code&gt;drie push&lt;/code&gt; where remarkably the bot stayed live, and so I ran some votes.  Michael joined me in a hangout as I updated the static website so that blog images would have a max-width of 700px (to save me re-sizing), and then worked on WebSiteOne to have members&amp;rsquo; titles update when they upgrade to Premium.  That was a nice set of three things to automate small tasks that are leaching away at my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I hope to keep iterating on automating away simple tasks so I can have more time for interacting with Premium members in Mob, F2F and Plus programming sessions!&lt;/p&gt;
