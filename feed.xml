    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pair flying" src="/images/pairflying.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I graduated a distance-learning masters in applied mathematics. Every month, the university mailed me an A4 enveloppe containing the course support. I was supposed to learn from the course material and returned the completed assignments within a month. A month later, I would receive an answer key.Â Should I have a question, I could mail it to the professor and wait for his reply. The whole process was cumbersome. I was often behind schedule. Interactivity was near to zero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I participated in the MOOC endeavour. The video of the instructor gave a feeling of a one-to-one training session. Discussion forums, deadlines, follow-up mails, peer-reviews grounded the learning process. There were meetups too. And a MOOC about Agile Development using Ruby On Rails offered remote pair-programming sessions between participants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair-programmming reuses the rather old organizational pattern of pilot+copilot : double-check, higher focusing, external view, and stronger engagement. You may object that programming is very different from flying. Yes, it is! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But programming requires a strong level of accuracy too. Your pairing fellow is both a watch dog that tells you not to call a library without checking how it works, not to cut and paste code across your work, and an inspiration to experiment with new ways of coding. As some aerobatic aircrafts don&amp;rsquo;t include a copilot seat, some programs are implemented by lone wolves in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like teamviewer, logmein, skype, hangout or joinme have been instrumental to the success of remote pair working. There is still room for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) In a face-to-face meeting, there is a desk between the two interlocutors. Webcams should recreate this confortable spacing. I&amp;rsquo;m neither a barber nor a dental professional!
2) Remote working platforms lack of interoperability. Some only run on Windows, some require to install a software, others are more suitable for mobile use&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t try to connect to hangout with skype
3) Security is a weak point for all of these platforms. Choosing which window you share, which you don&amp;rsquo;t, masking your passwords or your personal information are not intuitive. In my earlier days, I remembered displaying my passwords on a recorded session. Not so good a security practice!
4) Optimizing the screen definition so that everybody can watch comfortably is not supported either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every desktop application from IDE to word processors will probably include some kind of remote pair working feature sooner or later. C9 already includes some simple pair-programming features, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs in the code? Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me, it&amp;rsquo;s my pair programming partner who fooled around!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another free refill?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="free refill" src="/images/freerefill.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I undertook a training session targeting small business manager to teach them how to improve profitability of business projects. The course instructor showed us a rather clear way to deal with profitabiliy. First, you estimate your break-even hourly rate, based on your history. Then, you don&amp;rsquo;t sell any project under the bottom line. After that, you prioritize your work to put the highest priority on the most profitable projects. Finally, you keep any accepted project above the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple. It&amp;rsquo;s all down to the execution. I began to schedule my workday according to business priorities preferably to a sense of urgency that overcame me before. Then, everytime I felt I was at risk to hit the bottom line, I shifted my attention towards what I really sold to the client annd I reduced my objectives accordingly. Finally, I was trying to become a project reviewer for a well known MOOC platform. But the hourly rate was much too low. I felt relief to drop my candidature. Paid projects management improved greatly. But, a significant part of my workday, dedicated to volunteer projects, was out of the scope of this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many commitments, workaholism, things we begin and we never achieve, any freelance worker faces these contradictions. The inherent contradiction is even stronger when you work on non-paid project. How to prioritize your volunteer works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten working hours a day is my upper limit, considering that I&amp;rsquo;m not a computer nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a family, hobbies, and a social life &amp;hellip; I was already busy ten hours a day. Adding anything to my schedule implied removing something else. I have been more or less active on professional social networks for three years. I first thought this commitment would improve my reputation and fuel my prospect pipeline. But in three years, the return was not very encouraging. I felt that my social network activity was fueled by bitterness or anxiety or ego or the three rather than by a clear sense of business opportunity! I decided to forget social networks. Two to three hours a week were freed thanks to this good resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to devote these hours to Agile Venture mob programming sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s a real community, with real developers. You can both learn by observing how skilled developers work and by doing things by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the midstream of my prioritization effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very actively participating in MOOCs for five years. My skills greatly improved as a result of this effort.  But choosing which courses to invest on is not easy. Knowledge is a bit like indirects costs. You don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to assign it to your achievements. During the first years, the offer flourished. I tried many courses, from Economy to Computer Sciences. I progressively focused on Computer Science and left courses as they switched to paid offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was giving up, a prominent MOOC platform offers me to beta-test courses for free. Free refill is the end of resolution and the beginning of passive hyperactivity! You may begin your training week with a course on Embedded systems and end, on friday, with a course on PythonML on friday, without completing any. Does it make sense to participate in a mob programming session about RSPEC on monday, another one about phoenix on wednesday, on the last one about React on friday, when you only need to develop a small web app with React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileVenture Premium Mob includes some kind of Professional Development Planning Support. I may ask the team to help me clean my training plan. But I&amp;rsquo;m still afraid they will tell me to stop learning Tensor Flow or the nitty gritty of Intel Parallel Architecture if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any prospect to work in these fields in the next year! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Clearing the Backlog</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="backlog" src="/images/backlog.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m calling this clearing the backlog, but argh, I want to start on that new coding ticket rather than the older content ones in the WebSiteOne waffle board.  My heuristics for board review are check the &amp;ldquo;Please Check&amp;rdquo; tickets.  There I have a ticket from Matt where he hasn&amp;rsquo;t replied to my comments/queries - he&amp;rsquo;s moving house and has lots going on so no shock there.  That was also a request from Joao, so perhaps I should finish that up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I&amp;rsquo;ll only have one ticket assigned to me in any one column at a time.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a hanging ticket in &amp;ldquo;Please check&amp;rdquo; about providing a list of volunteer opportunities at AgileVentures &amp;hellip; I put that off as the priority dropped, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the way.  Okay, so let&amp;rsquo;s make this really about clearing the backlog, starting with that.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll update the branch there and kick of a build - hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll be green before the end of this blog and I can merge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s pull Matt&amp;rsquo;s branch onto my local machine to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1715_adjusting_premium_page_layout&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
â git checkout develop
Switched to branch &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'develop'&lt;/span&gt;
Your branch is up-to-date with &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'origin/develop'&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;develop&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
â git pull origin develop
From http://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; branch              develop    -&amp;gt; FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;tansaku@Samuels-MBP:~/Documents/Github/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;develop&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;
â git checkout 1750_client_type
Branch 1750_client_type &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;up to track remote branch 1750_client_type from origin.
Switched to a new branch &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'1750_client_type'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess part of me leans on I should be leaving this for Matt. However, I think I have to put the project and the wider community first here.  Perhaps my comments/suggestions were too pernickety and that put Matt off.  Perhaps I was being remiss in not just merging it earlier - the build was green, but I&amp;rsquo;m also the devops person who has to pick up the pieces if it goes wrong.  I had Praveen test his own new feature and bug fix on staging before deploying code yesterday - that seems like a good plan, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can put pressure on Matt on this one at this time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two things that I was asking Matt for were to pull the motivation for this feature into a separate feature file, although I note I didn&amp;rsquo;t do that myself in the opportunities link addition feature :-/  There was also checking the rest of the system about whether the introduction of a new event type would clash with other areas - doing a search over the codebase I see we do have checks for the two previous types in Twitter notifications, but we&amp;rsquo;ve turned those off, so that&amp;rsquo;s no biggy.  There&amp;rsquo;s something in the EventHelper module:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;EventHelper&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cover_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'PairProgramming'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;image_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'event-pairwithme-cover.png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Scrum'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;image_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'event-scrum-cover.png'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but all these places are looking like they have sensible defaults, so I think due dilligence is done.  The acceptance test, however, is only checking that if a client meeting exists that it will be shown correctly. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t check that a client meeting can actually be created.  So I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to pull out the feature I was thinking of.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my first pass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight gherkin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;@vcr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Provide a ClientMeeting Category
  As a project manager
  In order to be able to distinguish between client meetings and other types of meeting
  I would like to see and create "client meeting" events

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;Given following events exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;start_datetime&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;repeats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;time_zone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;repeats_weekly_each_days_of_the_week_mask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;repeats_every_n_weeks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ClientMtg&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Daily&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;meeting&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ClientMeeting&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;2014/02/03&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;11:00:00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;                                           &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;                       &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; I should not see &lt;span class="s"&gt;"End Date"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; I click on the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"event_date"&lt;/span&gt; div
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; I click the &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Save"&lt;/span&gt; button
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; I should see &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Event Created"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; the event &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Whatever"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; I should be on the event &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Show"&lt;/span&gt; page for &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Whatever"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; the event named &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Whatever"&lt;/span&gt; is associated with &lt;span class="s"&gt;"EdX"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;And I should see "09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;00-09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;(UTC)"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; I should see &lt;span class="s"&gt;"ClientMtg"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first scenario passes, but I have an unimplemented step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;When&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^I select "([^"]*)" from the event category dropdown$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;pending&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I implement that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;When(/^I select "([^"]*)" from the event category dropdown$/) do |category|
  page.select category, from: "event_category"
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tweak the feature a little - test in dev mode, and get the two scenarios both green.  Then by stashing all the code so far, checking out develop, and running the tests I can check that they fail when the functionality is removed, thus ensuring that we are properly testing the feature:&lt;/p&gt;

Feature: Provide a ClientMeeting Category
  As a project manager
  In order to be able to distinguish between client meetings and other types of meeting
  I would like to see and create "client meeting" events

  Background:                         # features/events/client_meetings.feature:7
    Given following events exist:     # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:32
      | name      | description          | category      | start_datetime          | duration | repeats | time_zone | project | repeats_weekly_each_days_of_the_week_mask | repeats_every_n_weeks |

    And I am logged in                # features/step_definitions/user_steps.rb:63
    And the following projects exist: # features/step_definitions/projects_steps.rb:6
      | title | description          | pitch | status | commit_count |

      | AAA   | for roadists         |       | active |              |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Show Client Meeting event           # features/events/client_meetings.feature:19
    Given the date is "2014/02/03 07:01:00 UTC" # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:94
    And I am on Events index page               # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:15
    Then I should see "ClientMtg"               # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:200
    And I should see "11:00-13:30 (UTC)"        # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:200

    And I fill in event field:                                    # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:152
      | name        | value          |

    And I should not see "End Date"                               # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:200
    And I click on the "event_date" div                           # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:106
    And I click the "Save" button                                 # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:96
    Then I should see "Event Created"                             # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:200
    Given the event "Whatever"                                    # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:324
    Then I should be on the event "Show" page for "Whatever"      # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:83
    And the event named "Whatever" is associated with "EdX"       # features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb:126
    And I should see "Event type: ClientMeeting"                  # features/step_definitions/basic_steps.rb:200

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/events/client_meetings.feature:26 # Scenario: Create Client Meeting event

2 scenarios (1 failed, 1 passed)
23 steps (1 failed, 8 skipped, 14 passed)
0m11.677s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I pushed it up into the branch, and left Matt the following note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@mattlindsey I&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and done the checks and adjusted the acceptance tests as I was suggesting - apologies if you were hoping to work on this, but I thought that given that it&amp;rsquo;s been open in the PRs for a month I should just get it cleared up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very happy to go through it with you when you have more time :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bad about missing the chance to work on it more closely with Matt, but now it&amp;rsquo;s building and hopefully I can merge it later today.  The opportunities link PR that I started a rebuild of at the beginning of this blog failed on what looks like one of our intermittent JS failures &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Scenario: A user can insert an image  

    Then the Mercury Editor modal window should be visible                                         # features/step_definitions/mercury_steps.rb:57
      expected to find css ".mercury-modal" but there were no matches (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/mercury_steps.rb:58:in `/^the Mercury Editor modal window should (not |)be visible$/'
      features/documents.feature:136:in `Then the Mercury Editor modal window should be visible'

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/documents.feature:130 # Scenario: A user can insert an image
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could add that to the exceptions, but that approach is dangerous as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget which tests are omitted in CI - Jon&amp;rsquo;s approach on LocalSupport to re-run failing tests seems more sensible.  I&amp;rsquo;d also love to get it so that we only output the full test details when they fail, which would also be addressed by Jon&amp;rsquo;s approach.  I&amp;rsquo;ll add that chore to the WSO issues - actually I find I already &lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1803"&gt;have one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a vote on that is in order &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AV EcoSystem Review Email What Next</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="whats next" src="/images/whats_next.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve looked back at my list from yesterday as I tried to work out how to start the week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) review the process of people coming in from adwords&lt;br&gt;
2) fix the email SPF setting&lt;br&gt;
3) more work on greeter bots&lt;br&gt;
4) search for other areas of ecosystem that are blocked up&lt;br&gt;
5) preparing that video for dropbox to debug github image embeds  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s looking like we&amp;rsquo;ve fixed the email SPF setting (thanks Federico!) and I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted the video to dropbox about their links not working in Github and Pivotal markdown, but they&amp;rsquo;ve not replied yet (checking the email sidetracked me while I unsubscribed from five things), so no joy on that getting fixed yet.  It might be procrastination, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll put off reviewing people flowing into the site for a week to see if I can get my easy  &amp;ldquo;insert-screenshot&amp;rdquo; functionality back.  I really want to put the new community-wide code of conduct into the website and the greeter bots, but the community is discussing it and so it might be good to leave that a couple of days (but no longer).  Thinking about important areas of the ecosystem, I&amp;rsquo;ve got hanging items in terms of WebSiteOne.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a slew of content tickets relating to Premium that have been hanging around for ages, and I said in last Friday&amp;rsquo;s WSO meeting that I&amp;rsquo;d take on the multiple source repository task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our project maintainers had dropped in the WSO channel to mention this was an issue - that&amp;rsquo;s a faily solid prod.  There&amp;rsquo;s no direct revenue growth attached to it, but the health of the community relies on active healthy projects.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also got to get the board cleared up - every hanging ticket is extra noise that I (and others) have to process every time we look at it &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just looking at the board, I got distracted by other tickets - checking that LocalSupport deployed to production correctly and that the latest code on WSO staging is making sense &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve kicked off the karma calculator there and should ask Praveen to check his features there &amp;hellip; but back to the board.   I&amp;rsquo;ve got one ticket for making the Premium page questions pop-out to reduce the amount of text on the page overall &amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://staging.agileventures.org/premium"&gt;https://staging.agileventures.org/premium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least edit that page on the staging server.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also saved an HTML copy into the staticpages view directory that will move the ticket from ready to in progress on the waffle board:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1816"&gt;https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1816&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also thinking that ultimately we may need to make these pages slightly less editable, and more generated.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.  I think other devs also need to have copies of them locally.  Either way I&amp;rsquo;ll get feedback on the staging server from the Marketing team before pushing live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. did a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/tansaku/6450f322f7505880872eb287c0ca36b0"&gt;node rep and included standardjs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="directions" src="/images/directions.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m conflicted - what direction next?  On the table are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) review the process of people coming in from adwords&lt;br&gt;
2) fix the email SPF setting&lt;br&gt;
3) more work on greeter bots&lt;br&gt;
4) search for other areas of ecosystem that are blocked up&lt;br&gt;
5) preparing that video for dropbox to debug github image embeds  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to see one of our adverts that Lara shared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Screenshot%202017-09-11%2009.00.27.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;rsquo;m still concerned about the message we&amp;rsquo;re sending, i.e. the absence of any mention of team skills or agile in that ad.  It&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating that I can&amp;rsquo;t immediately get a simple view of our actual ads from the Google Analytics interface.  We also got the concern that our ads seem to be showing up particularly heavily in India, and we&amp;rsquo;re not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I got the following from Elastic Email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Account sam@agileventures.org has one or more domains that were validated at one time but are no longer for some reason. How the domains became invalidated is not known but it is likely a configuration issue on your DNS for the domain(s) in question. It is important to take this step to ensure your emails are sending directly from your domain. Below is the list of domains that are not currently validated anymore: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;agileventures.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems like that the recent SPF change in the Gandi settings is the issue here.  I passed that on to Federico, who suggested the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 600 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_mailcust.gandi.net include:_spf.elasticemail.com ~allâ
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the change of Time To Live to 10 minutes instead of 3 hours, and the switch back to â~allââthe recommended policy statement. &amp;ldquo;?all&amp;rdquo; means neutral policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I replaced the current:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 10800 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_mailcust.gandi.net ?all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the suggested change, but I got this error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 5: Error while parsing rdata: newline in quoted string&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which was due to a non-ascii quote - switching that out and the DNS file saved.  Federico had shortened the TTL, so in principle we could check sooner if it was having the effect we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wait for that the frustration of wanting to embed an image made me want to record the video for dropbox.  I did that using the preview tab for creating this blog.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what I sent them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Marco,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this - here&amp;rsquo;s a video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/2rjda5vuqaj1b0g/DropboxLinksNotWorkingForImagesOnGithub.mov?dl=0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows me trying to preview an image embed from the following dropbox link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmurrdqxj76oq07/Screenshot%202017-09-11%2009.00.27.png?dl=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the image does not show up in preview - also note that for the last year links like these were showing up fine as images, so something somewhere changed recently.  As you&amp;#39;lls ee from the video GitHub grabs the image from you at dropbox and stores it on their own servers.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what Steve Guntrip at GitHub said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ?dl=1 is specified, we get redirected to the image file with a non-image Content-Type header, Content-Type: application/binary. For your image to load, this Content-Type should be an image, like Content-Type: image/png.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I would suggest reaching out to Dropbox&amp;rsquo;s support to see if they can maybe support embedding images if the user agent is github-camo (our service that downloads these images to githubusercontent.com), or if they have another solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best, Sam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s almost time to test the email, but maybe time for a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/tansaku/c311c996cc1521dceea0c0852849e9ca"&gt;quick node test rep&lt;/a&gt; and then I can check the email stuff by going to http://tools.wordtothewise.com/spf/check/AgileVentures.org and clicking on the DNS tab (as Federico suggested), where I see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/Screenshot%202017-09-11%2009.25.55.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I guess is telling me it&amp;rsquo;s working?  I can also send an email from my account that was previously marked as spam &amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s still coming through normally, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s sorted?  We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with Elastic Email &amp;hellip; I guess that&amp;rsquo;s enough progress for one day.  If I&amp;rsquo;m super lucky, I&amp;rsquo;ll get back the easy image embed functionality from dropbox/GitHub that&amp;rsquo;ll make reviewing everything else a lot easier &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, following my blog and email of yesterday I got the following response from Gandi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, it is the recipient&amp;rsquo;s email server rules that play to deliver the message to the recipient&amp;rsquo;s box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decrease the chance to be considered as spam by the recipient mail server, you can add the SPF record in your zone file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you can refer to the instructions page here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://doc.gandi.net/en/dns/zone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please delete the current SPF record below :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 10799 IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.elasticemail.com ~all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SPF records to be added is as below (please use edit mode : EXPERT):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 10800 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_mailcust.gandi.net ?all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above records indicate when mail is sent from the email server Gandi, normally, it is not spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that changes to your zone file will take around 3 hours to propagate on the Internet. Please wait for this propagation time before doing test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the SPF record, please see the online documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://wiki.gandi.net/en/dns/zone/spf-record&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I had the following from Federico&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the step-by-step video tutorial that Zoho Mail provides: https://docs.zoho.com/embed/28z4w99ee43ded3f14b3182bf0041c35042b7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. That one was purely SPF. This one is for DKIM &lt;em&gt;(3-min):&lt;/em&gt; https://docs.zoho.com/embed/281y6174f134d5f244817a38c7d32e4cd4c41&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâd rather scan text (DKIM): https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/dkim-configuration.html
SPF: https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/spf-configuration.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to review here, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to calm myself with an &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/tansaku/8e2ee25a007d9b706390513d53bbe191"&gt;athletic node test rep&lt;/a&gt;.  Ah, calming and I think 3 minutes to complete the rep.  So what&amp;rsquo;s the deal with this email?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandi is asking me to delete the spf1 record for elasticemail. Now this might have a negative impact on our newsletter sending but I guess I should just go ahead since we won&amp;rsquo;t be sending a newsletter for a while &amp;hellip; I scanned the text information on SPF and DKIM from Federico.  Not sure if we also need a DKIM but in the first instance I&amp;rsquo;ll do what Gandi instructs, removing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 10800 IN TXT "v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.elasticemail.com ~all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and replacing it with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ 10800 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_mailcust.gandi.net ?all"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so this will take up to 3 hours to propagate, and I should try a test of email sending after that.  Ah delayed feedback debugging, how I loathe thee :-)  And in the meantime I could try and follow Gandi&amp;rsquo;s other instructions to try and fix sending from sam@agileventures.org from my iPhone &amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s fixed now too, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
