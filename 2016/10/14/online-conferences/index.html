        <h5 class='date'>14 Oct 2016</h5>
    <p>Gave my first ever talk at a remote online conference on Thursday.  It&rsquo;s been a while since I spoke at any kind of conference actually.  I used to give talks pretty regularly as an academic and running meet ups, but I&rsquo;ve got out of the swing of it.  And giving a talk isn&rsquo;t coding, which is what I really want to be doing.  Although by the look of it most of my time is now taken up blogging, devops-ing and reviewing pull requests, but anyway.  I&rsquo;ve given talks in SecondLife and I&rsquo;ve been hosting online tutorials, remote pair programming and recording online lectures for students lots and lots over the last five years.  </p>

<p>So presenting for <a href="https://allremoteconfs.com/rails-2016">Rails Remote Conf</a> was not such a huge difference.  It was a hangout and there was a separate custom chat app from webinarjam to take incoming questions and comments from the audience.  I&rsquo;d done a fair amount of prep during the week by sharing some <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13196858/RailsRemoteConf-OpenSourceRailsCharityProject-SamJoseph.pdf">draft slides</a> with our core team.  Although looking back at it now and considering some of the other talks I saw at the conference I should have animated in the different bullets, and/or replaced all the text with images, and used the slides as speaker notes.  Next time I guess.</p>

<p>I was a little self-conscious that I wasn&rsquo;t deep diving on Rails tech, but conference organiser and host Charles Max Wood reassured me that he likes to have a couple of less technical talks in the conference, so I launched into it, trying to remind myself to speak slowly.  My bane.  I talk too fast.  Listening to lectures and podcasts on 2x doesn&rsquo;t help I&rsquo;m sure, but it&rsquo;s been a problem since my youth.  I guess I am a gabbler.  Maybe the text on the talk slides was not such a bad idea.  If people couldn&rsquo;t understand my accent or pace of delivery, they could at least read the slides :-)</p>

<p>I got a few comments and questions during the talk, which like usual hangout chat appear to have been lost to the ether when the session ended.  There was a question about how time-pressed project maintainers can manage lots of pull requests, and I responded with Pat Bolger&rsquo;s great points on my first draft about getting the whole team involved in the review of pull requests, and of course my big favourite, &ldquo;small PRs&rdquo;.  There wasn&rsquo;t extensive questioning at the end, hopefully because what I had said was transparently clear rather than just unutterably dull :-) Reassuringly I had some positive feedback by email afterwards from one audience member.</p>

<p>Despite the time zone difference I managed to catch a few of the other talks, which were pretty good.  <a href="https://twitter.com/philnash">Phil Nash</a> spoke about two factor authentication, <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw">Charles</a> about freelancing and <a href="http://nellshamrell.com/">Nell Shamrell</a> about estimates that don&rsquo;t suck.  Nell had a particularly interesting deep dive slide where she took apart a user story in terms of the technical specifics and gave points to each of those elements:</p>

<p><img alt="detailed tech estimate" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kmkkxvqgl2zmrh/Screenshot%202016-10-14%2010.05.22.png?dl=1" /> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NellShamrell/estimates-that-dont-suck">full slides from Nell&rsquo;s talk</a> have even more.  That 44 points Nell gets for the user story are multiplied by some factor, and that gives a 66.  Which using a scale introduced earlier:</p>

<p><img alt="points in days" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/104oec3yghsk1im/Screenshot%202016-10-14%2010.07.14.png?dl=1" /> </p>

<p>Implies that this feature would take about 8 days.  I asked Nell whether there was a danger in over specifying the implementation of the feature here, and she said that that was a possibility and that many teams just stayed at the user story level.   I was interested in this lower level estimating process, and I could imagine how if you had a really serious pressure to deliver, that this would be a very useful process.  In our pro-bono AgileVentures charity projects things take as long as they take, and the process of estimating is more about giving new developers a coherent idea of how long something might take, rather than giving higher ups information to make key business decisions; although we do need to do some of that as well.</p>

<p>I was probably too chatty in the limited time for chat after Nell&rsquo;s talk.  There was one other question from an audience member, and Charles mentioned an app for voting on estimates.  I was hoping to get more info on that since we&rsquo;re starting an AgileVentures project to build a tool for that.  The overall online conference format was fairly cool, but it was a shame to lose the chat history when each chat session shut down.  I would prefer a Slack instance for the conference where you could have a chat room for each talk that was persistent, and also some general hang-out rooms where people could continue conversations they had started in talk chats etc.</p>

<p>I wonder if we should do an AgileVentures conference at some point, and use our existing Slack instance to support the chat?  We&rsquo;ve got all the infrastructure we need with our AV events and hangouts system &hellip; would be great to get the project maintainers to each present on their projects, and get one or two devs to each also present on some of the work they&rsquo;ve been doing on the project.  I&rsquo;m always worried about meetings and conferences taking time away from coding, but maybe some sort of online conference is what we need for people to understand what we&rsquo;re all doing at AgileVentures?  I was also just listening to a podcast about Gitlab, which has 100&rsquo;s of purely remote employees, and how they have specific coffee-break, friendly chat hangouts.  Maybe AgileVentures needs more of these social get together things &hellip;?</p>
