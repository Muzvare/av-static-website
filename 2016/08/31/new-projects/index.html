        <h5 class='date'>31 Aug 2016</h5>
    <p>Yesterday Chris Manna joined us at the AgileVentures &ldquo;Kent Beck&rdquo; scrum.  Chris apparently found out about us from Columbia business school.  Thanks Columbia business school!  Chris has a charity project idea to help prison inmates through an education program.  Here it is in his words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi guys, I just started a company, (soon to be charity), that focuses on inmates from incarceration all the way through to job security; from jail to job and from prisoner to programmer</p>

<p>I think that there are a lot of smart people out there that haven&rsquo;t been given a fair shake at life and there are very few ventures that help inmates all the way from point A to point B.</p>

<p>Rates of recidivism in the US are terrible and rates of success for the recently incarcerated are so poor rehabilitation facilities rarely show their rates and charge exorbitant fees with no guarantees</p>

<p>The biggest correlation for success for inmates is the education that an inmate receives while in prison. I&rsquo;ve been working with a few inmates and found tremendous progress and I want to share my progress with others and help to educate a huge labor force</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a great project and just the kind of thing that AgileVentures is set up to support.  Chris taught himself coding and is also keen to level up his coding skills as well as get his project off the ground.  We&rsquo;re really looking forward to working with Chris on this.  Chris originally contacted me on email, and I encouraged him to join our Slack group, and then to attend one of our online scrums (using Google Hangouts).  He joined the &ldquo;Kent Beck&rdquo; scrum which is at 4:45pm UTC+1 Monday to Friday.  It&rsquo;s named after Kent Beck, one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto and leading proponent of TDD, XP and design patterns.</p>

<p>The scrum, or standup is intended to last no more than 15 minutes, and everyone who attends is in turn given a chance to talk about what they&rsquo;ve been working on, anything they are stuck on, and any plans.  The scrums are also intended as &ldquo;pair&rdquo; hookup events, so at the end of the session people can work out times for pair programming, which might be immediate or planned for later.  The scrums are also a forum for people like Chris to propose new projects.  We got round our usual scrum business in a few minutes and had plenty of time for Chris to talk about his project:</p>

<br/></p>

<p>We talked Chris through how AgileVentures works, how our free tier will provide free access to our slack instance, our regular online scrums, project logistical support, and UX review of project materials.  After a quick discussion I went ahead and created a channel on our slack for Chris&rsquo; project using the placeholder name of #inside_tech. Do jump in and join that room if you want to follow the project&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>Chris seemed pretty excited about finding a forum where he could immediately present his project ideas and get some help and support.  It was a great experience for us too.  It&rsquo;s wonderful when new projects start up.  We&rsquo;ve seen the initiation of several over the last year or two such as <a href="https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/metplus/">#metplus</a>, <a href="https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/project_unify/">#project_unify</a> <a href="https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/redeemify/">#redeemify</a> and <a href="https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/projectscope/">#projectscope</a>.  All new projects need nurturing and support, and at it&rsquo;s best that&rsquo;s what AgileVentures can provide to charity and non-profit projects.</p>

<p>Of course we need to make it sustainable.  We can&rsquo;t pour in resources indefinitely.  At least I don&rsquo;t think so any more.  When we started I was idealistic and thought that we could operate purely on a volunteer basis, and we&rsquo;ve come a very long way on the back of extraordinary efforts by teams of volunteers.  The difficulty with relying purely on a volunteer framework is that volunteers come and go, and it&rsquo;s difficult to predict the levels of support we can provide, and that makes things difficult for others considering whether they will put in their valuable time to contribute to one of our projects, or similarly to get a project off the ground with our help.</p>

<p>We added premium and premium plus plans over the last six months, and the ongoing contributions from those members are now covering our basic expenses (server hosting etc.) and if we can keep growing our premium base, may eventually cover the costs of maintaining a few part-time staff members.  Premium members get a guaranteed higher level of support, making it a simpler equation for them to be involved in AgileVentures.  They know that they&rsquo;ll get certain levels of support, and so that&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about when making decisions about how to invest their time.  Services to projects are on an &ldquo;as-available&rdquo; basis, so if there are lots of volunteers excited about your project then things can move fast, but as mentioned, those volunteer numbers ebb and flow.  However if you have a deadline or need something custom quickly, if you have some funding, then you can pay for development services to ensure that the critical solution you need is delivered on time.  More details about that at:</p>

<p><a href="http://nonprofits.agileventures.org">http://nonprofits.agileventures.org</a></p>

<p>Premium &amp; Premium Plus members and paying non-profit clients contribute to keeping AgileVentures around to provide support to new projects like Chris&rsquo; InsideTech and individual developers trying to improve their agile software and team skills in real projects.  Already we have premium members from the U.S., U.K., China, India, Poland, Sweden, South Africa and Slovenia.  There are many others around the world who could benefit from the mentoring support we give to volunteer developers on premium plans.  Even if you&rsquo;re not wanting to level up as a developer yourself, a donation of £10 a month will allow us to provide mentoring support to an underprivileged developer somewhere in the world. We&rsquo;ll give them professional code review, professional tool support and professional development advice. £100 a month will sponsor a Premium Plus membership which will give that developer two hours of face to face support by Google Hangouts, monthly.

<p>Let&rsquo;s support all the volunteers around the world, bring them together on worthy projects like Chris&rsquo; InsideTech, and give them the logistical, technical and project management advice to make those projects successful.  Together we really can make the world a better place!</p>
