        <h5 class='date'>21 Sep 2016</h5>
    <p>I got confused yesterday about adjustments to the pairing schedule.  I thought Michael was going to be available later in the day, but actually he had to leave early.   As a result our pairing was contracted to an hour, and he started on a new task working solo.  Michael was looking at adjusting the way we managed our 3rd party JavaScript assets in the WebSiteOne Rails app.  We&rsquo;ve been storing them in the vendor directory and checking them into our source code repository.  This doesn&rsquo;t make for a smooth upgrade and dependency management strategy.  </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been hearing that npm is becoming the standard for JavaScript dependency management, with bower falling out of favour.  Although clearly the <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-use-Bower-when-there-is-npm">conversation is still ongoing</a>.  Anyhow, Michael started some <a href="https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/pull/1278">solo work</a>, adding a package.json and a script to copy files from the node_modules directory into the rails vendor directory.  In our quick pairing session we got his spike working on my machine, and updated the install documentation.  After Michael had to go I made some adjustments to our CI and the heroku build packs to ensure that this would all work with the rest of our development pipeline.  I think I sorted the CI, but not the heroku, which required another solo pass from Michael after I got back, although the fact that I was migrating our servers from group to individual accounts means I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve been able to run a final check that the Heroku install works.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it&rsquo;s interesting that I would not have picked this particular task off the backlog if Michael and I were choosing together.  I&rsquo;d have been pushing for things that might have a more direct impact for our users.  Michael chose this one because he was interested in it, which is a great motivation.  I would also have been worried about opening a can of worms here.  However it seems like we might have been able to sort it in an otherwise chaotic day, and we&rsquo;ve explored an important part of our stack, as well as revealing some JavaScript files that shouldn&rsquo;t have been checked in.</p>

<p>Modern software engineer management often talks about groups like Steam or Github where groups of programmers just experiment with things that interest them and those things turn into &ldquo;product&rdquo; as a function of programmer interest.  I&rsquo;d find it easier to take that attitude if I was independently wealthy and not worrying about whether I&rsquo;ll have to go find a different job or completely pivot in three months or so :-)  However as I was saying in the heuristics blog yesterday, once you&rsquo;ve started a task &hellip; my strong temptation is often to try and switch tasks, or rebuild something, but maybe that&rsquo;s just too disruptive?  Strains the social bonds of the people you&rsquo;re working with?  Pick your battles they say :-)</p>

<p>Michael is looking ahead to interesting vistas involving replacing the whole Rails asset pipeline with npm and gulp, which is apparently the in-thing these days.  The issue that was highlighted to me yesterday is how we need to improve and update our installation documentation.  We&rsquo;ve migrated the wiki into the repo doc directory, but there&rsquo;s still a lot of cleanup to do.  I&rsquo;m also reminded that this stuff needs to be tested with installs on fresh machines.  I did an install on C9 yesterday which went smoothly, but made it look like this could be turned into an install script.</p>

<p>I also installed docker and used it to create a vanilla ubuntu instance, that I started installing WSO on.  Docker was great - installing WSO on ubuntu less so, with a series of sticking issues for the upfront install of phantomjs using npm.  I was pleased to find a way round my old friend:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>root@8c7aad239bc9:~# npm install -g phantomjs
npm WARN deprecated phantomjs@2.1.7: Package renamed to phantomjs-prebuilt. Please update 'phantomjs' package references to 'phantomjs-prebuilt'
npm WARN deprecated tough-cookie@2.2.2: ReDoS vulnerability parsing Set-Cookie https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/130
/root/.nvm/versions/node/v5.10.1/bin/phantomjs -&gt; /root/.nvm/versions/node/v5.10.1/lib/node_modules/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs

&gt; phantomjs@2.1.7 install /root/.nvm/versions/node/v5.10.1/lib/node_modules/phantomjs
&gt; node install.js

sh: 1: node: Permission denied
</code></pre>
<p>with http://sourcode.net/sh-1-node-permission-denied/</p>

<p>but that only lead me to a follow up error:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>root@8c7aad239bc9:~# npm install phantomjs
npm WARN deprecated phantomjs@2.1.7: Package renamed to phantomjs-prebuilt. Please update 'phantomjs' package references to 'phantomjs-prebuilt'

&gt; phantomjs@2.1.7 install /root/node_modules/phantomjs
&gt; node install.js

tar (child): bzip2: Cannot exec: No such file or directory
tar (child): Error is not recoverable: exiting now
tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
</code></pre>
<p>and it was getting late.  I did try a few things, but I left that to tinker with later.  I probably should get more into docker and look into not accessing that ubuntu image as root.  I&rsquo;m intrigued by the idea of publishing a WSO docker image and/or docker install script.  What would be really nice would be if our install scripts (docker or otherwise) could be run via acceptance tests.  It&rsquo;s ironic that our CI is installing the app from scratch a dozen times a day.  We really should have an instantaneous deploy for anyone wanting to get set up with the project.</p>

<p>So anyway, maybe me screwing up the pairing schedule was serendipitous.  I often find myself shy of things that I think will take a long time, but then my intuitions are also wrong sometimes.  I remember when an AV volunteer (Pavel) first set up Travis for us.  Not knowing much about it it felt like a big thing to get into; and then I saw that all Pavel had done was flick a switch and add a .travis.yml file.  Of course there&rsquo;s a lot more to go wrong with CI as your project gets bigger, but sometimes the younger person just giving things a try, reveals that the older person&rsquo;s fears of a briar patch are unfounded.  And then there are other times when the older person&rsquo;s fears are correct and you get stuck in a sticky mess.  If only one could predict reliably which way round it&rsquo;s going to end up &hellip; :-)  </p>

<p>So my moral for today is pair with people of all levels, and don&rsquo;t beat yourself up too much when you screw up the schedule, or start on a task you have misgivings about.  Better to enjoy the process and see what emerges :-)</p>
